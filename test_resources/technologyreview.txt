										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, March 11, 2022, marks two years since covid-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We’ve had lockdowns, vaccines, and arguments about how to move forward and live with this virus. We’ve watched the pandemic through numbers and data and memorials to the many lives lost, officially now over six million. It is likely this figure is a vast undercount. A study published in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02796-3/fulltext">The Lancet</a> this week estimated that the true number may be three times higher, at 18.2 million. </p>



<p>And, in a <a href="https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19-and-ukraine-9-march-2022">statement</a> marking the two-year anniversary, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned: “Although reported cases and deaths are declining globally, and several countries have lifted restrictions, the pandemic is far from over—and it will not be over anywhere until it’s over everywhere.”</p>



<p>In some parts of the world things look like they may be turning a corner. Vaccines have significantly reduced the worst effects of covid-19, with over 10 billion doses delivered worldwide. And after omicron’s increased infectiousness led to a vast wave of new cases, infection rates are <em>finally </em>falling in the US.</p>



<p>However, vaccine distribution remains starkly uneven, and unequal. While many of the world’s richest countries have vaccinated and boosted most of their population, poorer countries have been left to fall far behind. Across <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html">vast swaths of Africa</a>, most people have yet to get even their first covid-19 vaccine dose. Some countries are still battling vast and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/10/world/covid-19-mandates-cases-vaccine/omicron-cases-continue-to-spike-in-parts-of-asia">growing</a> case rates, especially in Asia. The situation in Hong Kong is <a href="https://twitter.com/tomgrundy/status/1502229988481052674">grim</a> right now. </p>



<p>That means there is little cause for complacency. With the virus still circulating widely, the risk of a dangerous new variant remains very real.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two years on, we’re also still arguing over where and why covid-19 started in the first place, because scientists are still hunting for the definitive clues. </p>



<p><strong>Welcome to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/curious-coincidence/?truid=*%7CLINKID%7C*&amp;utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*">Curious Coincidence</a>. </strong>A five-part podcast that tells the story of the hunt for those clues. Hosted by our senior editor for biomedicine, Antonio Regalado, it’s a detective story about the genome of the virus, about people in labs doing sensitive research on dangerous germs and the crisis they’re in now.&nbsp;</p>



<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="175" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/welcome-to-curious-coincidence/id1609482049?i=1000550717831"></iframe>



<p>It’s a story about why people remain silent and why they speak out. It’s about the sheer power of biotechnology, the science that allowed us to develop vaccines quickly—but also might be what got us into trouble in the first place.</p>



<p>Why is it so hard to find out its origin story, and why does the search matter?</p>



<p>As Natasha Loder, health policy editor at the Economist, says in the podcast: “You can’t learn from history if you don’t know what your history is, if your history is buried.” </p>

<p>Deep in the ocean, below the reach of wind-driven currents but well above the seafloor, lies an in-between world—the eerily still midwaters, dominated by alien-looking, gelatinous life forms.&nbsp;Here ctenophores swim about using glittering comb-legs, colonies of siphonophore clones stretch a hundred feet long, and giant larvaceans secrete elaborate mucus structures.</p>



<p>These strange inhabitants of the midwater, also called the twilight zone, are notoriously difficult to study. Their bodies are so insubstantial that capturing them has been likened to trying to catch fog in a net and then pickle it in a jar. Even if you do manage to capture specimens intact, they tend to dissolve in preservatives.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><strong><em>To support MIT Technology Review&#8217;s journalism, please consider <a href="https://forms.technologyreview.com/subscriptions/">becoming a subscriber</a></em></strong>.</p></blockquote>



<p>But two new imaging systems developed by a team at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) in California promise to make these intangible creatures tangible at last. The systems, called DeepPIV and EyeRIS, create 3D renderings of gelatinous deep-sea creatures. Together, they can capture an animal’s every feature on a millimeter scale—the structure of internal organs, even food moving through its digestive tract.<strong> </strong>The MBARI team believes the scans will help researchers describe these fragile species for the first time and perhaps even reduce the time between the first discovery of a creature and its formal introduction to science—which a 2012 study calculated takes <a href="https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0960982212012481?token=D1439E697469CD00CB10E316354FC7795637EBD02F7C0AB5FBC3C633DA6F5A853333DE3431751ACCBF13CD2CA35D085E&amp;originRegion=eu-west-1&amp;originCreation=20220303205547">an average of 21 years</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On <a href="https://schmidtocean.org/cruise/designing-the-future-2/">an expedition</a> with the Schmidt Ocean Institute off the coast of San Diego in August 2021, MBARI sent the pair of tools—along with a specialized DNA sampling apparatus—hundreds of meters deep to explore the midwaters. The researchers used the cameras to scan at least two unnamed creatures, a new ctenophore and siphonophore.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/S0453_Solmissus.mp4"></video><figcaption>Raw footage of a dinner plate jelly (genus <em>Solmissus</em>), taken with DeepPIV during a 2021 expedition.</figcaption><div class="video-credit">JOOST DANIELS © 2021 MBARI</div>
</figure>



<p>The successful scans strengthen the case for virtual holotypes—digital, rather than physical, specimens that can serve as the basis for a species definition when collection isn’t possible. Historically, a species’ holotype has been a physical specimen meticulously captured, preserved, and catalogued—an anglerfish floating in a jar of formaldehyde, a fern pressed in a Victorian book, or a beetle pinned to the wall of a natural history museum. Future researchers can learn from these and compare them with other specimens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Proponents say virtual holotypes like 3D models are our best chance at documenting the diversity of marine life, some of which is on the precipice of being lost forever. Without a species description, scientists can’t monitor populations, identify potential hazards, or push for conservation measures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“The ocean is changing rapidly: increasing temperatures, decreasing oxygen, acidification,” says <a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu/staff/allen-collins">Allen Collins</a>, a jelly expert with dual appointments at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. “There are still hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions, of species to be named, and we can’t afford to wait.”&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Jelly in four dimensions&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Marine scientists who research gelatinous midwater creatures all have horror stories of watching potentially new species disappear before their eyes. Collins recalls trying to photograph ctenophores in the wet lab of a NOAA research ship off the coast of Florida: “Within a few minutes, because of either the temperature or the light or the pressure, they just started falling apart,” he says. “Their bits just started coming off. It was a horrible experience.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mbari.org/katija-kakani/">Kakani Katija</a>, a bioengineer at MBARI and the driving force behind DeepPIV and EyeRIS, didn’t set out to solve the midwater collector’s headache. “DeepPIV was developed to look at fluid physics,” she explains. In the early 2010s, Katija and her team were<strong> </strong>studying how sea sponges filter-feed and wanted a way to track the movement of water by recording the three-dimensional positions of minute particles suspended in it.</p>



<p>They later realized the system could also be used to noninvasively scan gelatinous animals. Using a powerful laser mounted on a remotely operated vehicle, DeepPIV illuminates one cross-section of the creature’s body at a time. “What we get is a video, and each video frame ends up as one of the images of our stack,” says <a href="https://www.mbari.org/daniels-joost/">Joost Daniels</a>, an engineer in Katija’s lab who’s working to refine DeepPIV. “And once you’ve got a stack of images, it’s not much different from how people would analyze CT or MRI scans.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, DeepPIV produces a still 3D model—but marine biologists were eager to observe midwater creatures in motion. So Katija, MBARI engineer Paul Roberts, and other members of the team created a light-field camera system dubbed EyeRIS that detects not just the intensity but also the precise directionality of light in a scene. A microlens array between the camera lens and image sensor breaks the field down into multiple views, like the multi-part vision of a housefly.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/EyeRIS_FocusDepthMap_Solmissus.mp4"></video><figcaption>A <em>Solmissus</em> jelly, as imaged by EyeRIS. The color scale indicates distance to the camera, with red closer and blue farther away.</figcaption><div class="video-credit">PAUL ROBERTS © 2021 MBARI</div>
</figure>



<p>EyeRIS’s raw, unprocessed images look like what happens when you take your 3D glasses off during a movie—multiple offset versions of the same object. But once sorted by depth, the footage resolves into delicately rendered three-dimensional videos, allowing researchers to observe behaviors and fine-scale locomotive movements (jellies are experts at jet propulsion).&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>What’s a picture worth?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Over the decades, researchers have occasionally attempted to describe new species without a traditional holotype in hand—a <a href="https://zookeys.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=6143">South African bee fly</a> using only high-definition photos, a <a href="https://avianres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40657-016-0043-4">cryptic owl</a> with photos and call recordings. Doing so can incur the wrath of some scientists: in 2016, for example, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27988669/">hundreds of researchers</a> signed a letter defending the sanctity of the traditional holotype.</p>



<p>But in 2017, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature—the governing body that publishes the code dictating how species should be described—issued a clarification of its rules, stating that<strong> </strong>new species can be characterized without a physical holotype in cases where collection isn’t feasible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, a team of scientists including Collins described a new genus and species of comb jelly based on high-definition video. (<em>Duobrachium sparksae, </em>as it was christened, looks something like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RwXLhr9DRc">translucent Thanksgiving turkey with streamers trailing from its drumsticks</a>.) Notably, there was no grumbling from the taxonomist peanut gallery—a win for advocates of digital holotypes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collins says the MBARI team’s visualization techniques only strengthen the case for digital holotypes, because they more closely approximate the detailed anatomical studies scientists conduct on physical specimens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A parallel movement to digitize existing physical holotypes is also gaining steam. <a href="https://profiles.si.edu/display/nOsbornK8182011">Karen Osborn</a> is a midwater invertebrate researcher and curator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annelid#:~:text=The%20annelids%20%2F%CB%88%C3%A6n,ragworms%2C%20earthworms%2C%20and%20leeches.&amp;text=The%20basic%20annelid%20form%20consists%20of%20multiple%20segments">annelids</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peracarida">peracarids</a>—animals much more substantial and easier to collect than the midwater jellies—at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Osborn says the pandemic has underlined the utility of high-fidelity digital holotypes. Countless field expeditions have been scuttled by travel restrictions, and annelid and peracarid researchers “haven’t been able to go in [to the lab] and look at any specimens,” she explains, so they can’t describe anything from physical types right now. But study is booming through the digital collection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using a micro-CT scanner, Smithsonian scientists have given researchers around the world access to holotype specimens in the form of “3D reconstructions in minute detail.” When she gets a specimen request—which typically involves mailing the priceless holotype, with a risk of damage or loss—Osborn says she first offers to send a virtual version. Although most researchers are initially skeptical, “without fail, they always get back to us ‘Yeah, I don’t need the specimen. I’ve got all the information I need.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“EyeRIS and DeepPIV give us a way of documenting things in situ, which is even cooler,” Osborn adds. During research expeditions, she’s seen the system in action on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2345-2??utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_campaign=CONR_PF018_ECOM_GL_PHSS_ALWYS_PRODUCT&amp;utm_content=productdatafeed&amp;utm_term=PID100052172&amp;CJEVENT=8e3b8fa494bc11ec8275a3330a82b820">giant larvaceans</a>, small invertebrates whose intricate “snot palaces” of secreted mucus scientists had never been able to study completely intact—until DeepPIV.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Katija says the MBARI team is pondering ways to gamify species description along the lines of <a href="https://fold.it/">Foldit</a>, a popular citizen science project in which “players” use a video-game-like platform to determine the structure of proteins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same spirit, citizen scientists could help analyze the images and scans taken by ROVs. “Pokémon Go had people wandering their neighborhoods looking for fake things,” Katija says. “Can we harness that energy and have people looking for things that aren’t known to science?”</p>

<p>Running a healthcare system is like juggling bees. Millions of moving pieces—from mobile clinics to testing kits—need to be in the right places at the right time. That’s even harder to do in countries with limited resources and endemic disease.</p>



<p>But getting stuff where it’s needed is a problem big companies deal with all the time. Now global healthcare groups are adopting some of their techniques: a number of the world’s poorer countries have started to use AI-powered supply-chain management tools to help people get better access to testing and treatment.</p>



<p>Healthcare organizations are using the software to help decide where to set up new clinics, how to allocate equipment and staff, and what spending to prioritize. And the same tools could soon end up helping to run health programs in the US, too.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/11/17-191916.pdf">Only 1% of clinics and 14% of hospitals</a>&nbsp;in low- and middle-income countries have the equipment or staff they need to diagnose endemic diseases, such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, according to a 2017 report in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization. A commission set up by the medical journal the Lancet in 2021 concluded that nearly half of the world’s population has limited or no access to testing services. Even when tests are available, the results are often inaccurate or come too late to be of clinical use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Global health organizations have realized that if you zoom out far enough, these shortcomings start to look a lot like a supply-chain problem. “Why is it that Coca-Cola can deliver ice-cold cola to some of the most remote places in the world but we can’t do something similar in health care?” asks John Sargent, a doctor and co-founder of BroadReach Group. The health care delivery organization manages one of the world’s largest HIV care and treatment programs using AI software, including digital twins—tools that simulate complex processes by mirroring real-world resources such as goods, warehouses, and transport links.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/topic/artificial-intelligence/">Machine learning algorithms</a>&nbsp;can use these simulations to predict problems and propose solutions.</p>





<p>Over the last few years, companies across industries from retail to manufacturing have started using digital twins to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/10/26/1038643/ai-reinforcement-learning-digital-twins-can-solve-supply-chain-shortages-and-save-christmas/">weather the worst of the world’s ongoing supply-chain disruptions</a>. “We wanted to step back and look at a country’s whole health care network,” says Heidi Albert, head of FIND South Africa. “That’s what led us to supply-chain thinking.” FIND (Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics) is a nonprofit based in Switzerland. Testing is one of the weakest links in global health care, says Albert: “Our aim is to make sure that everyone who needs a test has access to one.”</p>



<p>That involves allocating a limited number of resources across an entire health care system, turning it into an optimization problem: how to make the most of what’s available. By&nbsp;modeling&nbsp;resources and the dependencies between them, digital twins identify gaps in a service, anticipate disruptions, and tweak the setup to explore various possible scenarios.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIND is working with US-based Coupa, a business-management software vendor, to build a tool for optimizing testing services. Coupa has been adapting its business software called OptiDx for health care applications for the last four years. By using a range of computational techniques to model and analyze complex processes, including machine learning, its tools predict demand and identify optimal setups to meet it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>OptiDx is designed to use that technology to help health care managers, from government officials to nurses, allocate resources effectively, making sure that equipment and staff are in the best locations. By simulating increased demand in the digital twin of a country’s testing facilities, for example, the government can see what additional clinics and equipment it might need and tweak variables to explore hypothetical scenarios.</p>



<p>FIND and Coupa have already piloted the software in Zambia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Burkina Faso. In Zambia, the tool’s recommendations cut the average distance HIV test samples had to be transported to three miles—11 times less than before.</p>



<p>FIND is now rolling OptiDx out to 15 more countries, including Kenya, Lesotho, India, and the Philippines. In the Philippines the software has shown that one clinic could conduct the same number of tests with fewer instruments than expected, allowing the clinic to reallocate some of its budget.</p>



<p>FIND is monitoring whether the tool’s recommendations are useful as well as whether they are put into practice. “This needs to be something that countries can own themselves,” says Albert. “A key thing is to put the power of the data in the hands of the people [who] need to make the decisions.”</p>



<h3><strong>Catching up to smartphones</strong></h3>



<p>BroadReach uses a simulation tool called Vantage, built in partnership with Microsoft, to identify understaffed clinics and send health care workers where they are needed most. In 2020, during the first few weeks of the pandemic, BroadReach worked with FIND to assess how prepared two provinces in South Africa were for covid, flagging shortages in protective equipment and staff in more than 300 clinics in just three days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sargent says he learned about health care systems in Africa firsthand when working in refugee camps before he went to medical school. He later founded BroadReach with fellow doctor Ernest Darkoh, who grew up in Tanzania and Kenya. “You can go into rural clinics in places like Zambia, and you will see patient records sitting around on paper,” says Sargent. Yet the technology is there: “The nurses are using smartphones and Facebook is suggesting posts they might like.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><strong><em>To support MIT Technology Review&#8217;s journalism, please consider <a href="https://forms.technologyreview.com/subscriptions/">becoming a subscriber</a></em></strong>.</p></blockquote>



<p>In addition to monitoring shortages, BroadReach tracks individual patients across more than a thousand clinics in several African countries, monitoring whether they are getting the treatment they need as well as continuing to follow it. Clinics already do that, but Vantage also uses machine learning, trained on hundreds of thousands of anonymized clinical records and social data, to identify people who are likely to drop out of treatment and suggest that health care workers check in with them proactively.</p>



<p>The Institute of Virology Nigeria used Vantage in 2021 to predict which of 30,000 people being treated for HIV across three sites in Nigeria were at risk of stopping their medication. The tool found that 91% of those who received a call or visit from a health care worker as a result were up to date with their medication, compared with 55% of those who had not been contacted.</p>



<p>According to BroadReach, health care workers at a number of HIV clinics have said that the tool helps them maintain closer relationships with their patients by helping them focus on those most in need of intervention.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The so-called developed world</strong></h3>



<p>BroadReach now wants to make its software available in the US. “Right around the time covid hit we sort of woke up to realize that a lot of quote-unquote developed-world health systems weren’t that great, and large swaths of the population were being left behind,” says Sargent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BroadReach is involved in four pilot projects with US health care providers and insurers. In one, it tackled low rates of vaccinations in parts of Colorado by using machine learning to predict where vaccination sites should be set up and which communities should be canvassed. Local health officials had assumed that resources should be focused on urban areas to vaccinate as many people as possible. But Vantage revealed that focusing on low-income rural, minority communities would have a greater impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BroadReach is also working with an insurer in California that sees significant disparities in the way people in various groups keep to a treatment regimen of statins, drugs used to treat high cholesterol. By looking at the data, BroadReach wants to identify potential explanations for what the insurer is finding. Some communities have poor transport links to clinics, which may stop people from visiting their doctors to update prescriptions. Others simply have a longstanding distrust of the health care system, says Sargent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually he wants to see Vantage predict risk factors for individual patients. For example, for a Spanish speaker who does not live near a clinic, the software would recommend that the insurer provide a Spanish-speaking social worker and a voucher for a taxi, he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it’s difficult to get hold of the data needed to train AI to make such predictions accurately. In the US, health care data is typically not shared between providers. Sargent says BroadReach is getting around this by combining medical records with socioeconomic data, such as people’s ZIP codes and credit histories. “We have partnerships with consumer data companies, because you can tell a lot about a patient if you know their patterns of&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;and what conditions they live in,” he says. “We stitch all of this together to get a view of an overall population and a view of each patient.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>How people feel about this kind of surveillance will depend on what benefits it actually brings them. A range of bodies—including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/17/1026519/racial-bias-noisy-data-credit-scores-mortgage-loans-fairness-machine-learning/">credit companies</a>,<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/11/1017955/auditors-testing-ai-hiring-algorithms-bias-big-questions-remain/">&nbsp;hiring agencies</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/17/1005396/predictive-policing-algorithms-racist-dismantled-machine-learning-bias-criminal-justice/">police</a>, and more—already use the socioeconomic data BroadReach draws on to predict the likely future&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;of individuals. Biases in these systems have rightly led to strong pushback from civil rights groups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Government proposals to share medical data in several countries have generated backlash, including in the US, the UK, and Australia, says Nicholson Price, who studies legal and ethical questions around the use of personal data at the University of Michigan. But that hasn’t stopped companies from combining medical and consumer data. “Companies have been doing this for several years, just at a lower profile,” says Price.</p>



<p>“There’s a sense of resignation that it’s happening and we appear to have no ability to stop it,” he says. “That said, maybe there’s a silver lining that some good stuff will come out of this, too, instead of just being advertised at and manipulated.”</p>

<p>Fueled by innovations in AI, IoT, and blockchain, digital transformation has been accelerating rapidly across industries. But as the world’s data is growing at the edge, the stark differences in digital equity and inclusion have become clear. Access to technology, underrepresentation within tech companies, and bias within technology itself contribute to this stark digital divide, says Janice Zdankus, vice president of strategy and planning and innovation for social impact at HPE.</p>



<p>From health care to manufacturing to agriculture, many organizations don’t have a handle on the data they generate. While data is being created quickly, companies often lack a strategy to organize, share and account for bias in their data. &#8220;I think we see today that there&#8217;s not an equitable exchange of data and those producing data aren&#8217;t always seeing the value back to them for sharing their data,” says Zdankus.</p>



<p>Democratizing data access is key to bolstering data inclusion and equity but requires sophisticated data organization and sharing that doesn’t compromise privacy. Rights management governance and high levels of end-to-end security can help ensure that data is being shared without security risks, says Zdankus.</p>



<p>Ultimately, improving digital inclusion and equity comes down to company culture. “It can&#8217;t just be a P&amp;L [profit and loss] decision. It has to be around thought leadership and innovation and how you can engage your employees in a way that&#8217;s meaningful in a way to build relevance for your company,” says Zdankus. Solutions need to be value-based to foster goodwill and trust among employees, other organizations, and consumers.</p>



<p>“If innovation for equity and inclusion were that easy, it would&#8217;ve been done already,” says Zdankus. The push for greater inclusion and equity is a long-term and full-fledged commitment. Companies need to prioritize inclusion within their workforce and offer greater visibility to marginalized voices, develop interest in technology among young people, and implement systems thinking that focuses on how to bring individual strengths together towards a common outcome.</p>

<p><em>Laurel Ruma: </em>From MIT Technology Review, I&#8217;m Laurel Ruma. And this is Business Lab. The show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace. Our topic today is digital inclusion and equity. The pandemic made clear that access to tech isn&#8217;t the same for everyone. From broadband access to bias and data to who is hired, but innovation and digital transformation need to work for everyone. And that&#8217;s a challenge for the entire tech community.</p>



<p>Two words for you. Unconditional inclusivity.</p>



<p>My guest is Janice Zdankus, who is the vice president of strategy and planning and innovation for social impact at HPE.</p>



<p>This episode of Business Lab is produced in association with Hewlett Packard Enterprise.</p>



<p>Welcome Janice.</p>



<p><em>Janice Zdankus:</em> Hi there. Great to be here.</p>



<p><em>Laurel:</em> So, you&#8217;ve been hosting HPE&#8217;s Element podcast this season, and the episodes focus on inclusion. In your conversations with experts about digital equity—which includes balancing business and social agendas, biasing data, and how companies can use digital equity as a means of innovation—what sorts of innovative thinking and approaches stand out to you?</p>



<p><em>Janice:</em> So, we&#8217;ve been talking a lot about ways that technology and innovative approaches can actually be useful for tackling equity and inclusion. And we&#8217;ve had a number of very interesting guests and topics ranging from thinking about how bias in media can be detected, all the way into thinking about trustworthy AI and how companies can actually build in an innovation agenda with digital equity in mind.</p>



<p>So, one example would be, we recently spoke to Yves Bergquist, who&#8217;s the director of the entertainment technology center at the University of Southern California. And he leads a research center focusing on AI in neuro neuroscience and media. And he shared with us an effort to use AI, to actually scan images, to scan scripts, to watch movies and detect common uses of stereotypes to also look at how bias can be associated with stereotypes, whether intentional or not in the creation of a media piece, for example, and then to help provide that information on thousands of scripts and movies back to script writers and script reviewers and movie producers, so that they can start to increase their awareness and understanding of how the selection of certain actors or directors use of certain images and approaches can lead to an impression of bias.</p>



<p>And so by being able to automate that using AI, it really makes the job easier for those in the profession to actually understand how maybe, in an unconscious way they&#8217;re creating bias or creating an illusion that maybe they didn&#8217;t intend to. So that&#8217;s an example of how technology is really assisting human-centered, thinking about how we&#8217;re using media to influence.</p>



<p><em>Laurel:</em> That&#8217;s amazing because that&#8217;s an industry that may be, I mean, obviously there&#8217;s technology involved, but maybe a bit surprised that AI could be actually used in such a way.</p>



<p><em>Janice: </em>Yeah. AI has a lot of ability to scan and learn way beyond the scale that the human brain can do that in. But I think there&#8217;s also you have to be careful when you&#8217;re talking about AI and how AI models are trained and the possibility for bias being introduced into those models. So, you really have to think about it end-to-end.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>So, if we dig a little deeper into the components of inclusion and digital equity issues, like starting with where we are now, what does the landscape look like at this point? And where are we falling short when it comes to digital equity?</p>



<p><em>Janice: </em>There&#8217;s three ways to think about this. One being is their bias within the technology itself. An example, I just mentioned around AI potentially being built on bias models, is certainly one example of that. The second is who has access to the technology. We have quite a disproportionate set of accessibility to cellular, to broadband, to technologies itself across the world. And the third is what is the representation of underrepresented groups, underserved groups in tech companies overall, and all three of those factors contribute to where we could be falling short around digital equity.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>Yeah. That&#8217;s not a small amount of points there to really think about and dig through. But when we&#8217;re thinking about this through the tech lens, how has the enormous increase in the volume of data affected digital equity?</p>



<p><em>Janice: </em>So, it&#8217;s a great thing to point out. There is a ton of data growing, at what we call at the edge, at the source of where information gets created. Whether it be on a manufacturing line or on an agricultural field, or whether sensors detecting creation of processes and information. In fact, most companies, I think more than 70% of companies say they don&#8217;t have a full grasp on data being created in their organizations that they may have access to. So, it&#8217;s being created. The problem is: is that data useful? Is that data meaningful? How is that data organized? And how do you share that data in such a way that you can actually gain useful outcomes and insights for it? And is that data also potentially being created in a way that&#8217;s biased from the get-go?</p>



<p>So, an example for that might be, I think a common example that we hear about a lot is, gosh, a lot of medical testing is done on white males. And so therefore does that mean the outcomes from medical testing that&#8217;s occurring and all the data gathered on that should only be used or applied to white males? Is there any problem around it not representing females or people of color, could those data points gathered from testing in a broader, more diverse range of demographics result in different outcomes? And that&#8217;s really an important thing to do.</p>



<p>The second thing is around the access to the data. So yes, data is being generated in increasing volumes far more than we predicted, but how is that data being shared and are the people collecting or the machines or the organizations collecting that data willing to share it?</p>



<p>I think we see today that there&#8217;s not an equitable exchange of data and those producing data aren&#8217;t always seeing the value back to them for sharing their data. So, an example of that would be smallholder farmers around the world of which 70% are women, they may be producing a lot of information about what they&#8217;re growing and how they&#8217;re growing it. And if they share that to various members along the food system or the food supply chain, is there a benefit back to them for sharing that data, for example? So, there are other examples of this in the medical or health field. <a>So</a> there might be private information about your body, your images, your health results. How do you share that for the benefit in an aggregated way of society or for research without compromising privacy?</p>



<p>I mean, an example of addressing this is the introduction of swarm learning where data can be shared, but it can also be held private. So, I think this really highlights the need for rights management governance, high levels, and degrees of security end-to-end and trust ensuring that the data being shared is being used and the way it was intended to be used. I think the third challenge around all this is that the volume of data is almost too wieldy to work with, unless you really have a sophisticated technology system. In many cases there&#8217;s an increasing demand for high performance computing and GPUs. At HPE, for example, we have high performance computing as a service offered through GreenLake, and that&#8217;s a way to help create greater access or democratizing the access to data, but having systems and ways or I&#8217;ll call it data spaces to share, distributed and diverse data sets is going to be more and more important as we look at the possibilities of sharing across not just within a company, but across companies and across governments and across NGOs to actually drive the benefit.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>Yeah and across research bodies and hospitals and schools as the pandemic has told us as well. That sort of sharing is really important, but to keep the privacy settings on as well.</p>



<p><em>Janice: </em>That&#8217;s right. And that&#8217;s not widely available today. That&#8217;s an area of innovation that really needs to be applied across all of the data sharing concepts.</p>



<p><em>Laurel:</em> There&#8217;s a lot to this, but is there a return on investment for enterprises that actually invest in digital equity?</p>



<p><em>Janice: </em>So, I have a problem with the question and that&#8217;s because we shouldn&#8217;t be thinking about digital equity only in terms of, does it improve the P&amp;L [profit and loss]. I think there&#8217;s been a lot of effort recently done to try to make that argument to<a> </a>bring the discussion back to the purpose. But ultimately to me, this is about the culture and purpose of a company or an organization. It can&#8217;t just be a P&amp;L decision. It has to be around thought leadership and innovation and how you can engage your employees in a way that&#8217;s meaningful in a way to build relevance for your company. I think one of the examples that NCWIT, the National Center for Women Information Technology used to describe the need for equity and inclusion is that inclusion changes what&#8217;s possible.</p>



<p>So, when you start to think about innovation and addressing problems of the long term, you really need to stretch your thinking and away from just the immediate product you&#8217;re creating next quarter and selling for the rest of the year. It needs to be values-based set of activities that oftentimes can bring goodwill, can bring trust. It leads to new partnerships, it grows new pipelines.</p>



<p>And the recent Trust Barometer published by Edelman had a couple of really interesting data points. One being that 86% of consumers expect brands to act beyond their product in business. And they believe that trust pays dividends. That 61% of consumers will advocate for a brand that they trust. And 43% will remain loyal to that brand even through a crisis. And then it&#8217;s true for investors too. They also found that 90% of investors believe that a strong ESG [Environmental, Social and Governance] performance makes for better long-term investments for a company. And then I think what we&#8217;ve seen really in spades here at Hewlett Packard Enterprise is that our employees really want to be a part of these projects because it&#8217;s rewarding, <a>it&#8217;s</a> value aligned, and it gives them exposure to really sometimes very difficult problems around solving for. If innovation for equity and inclusion were that easy, it would&#8217;ve been done already.</p>



<p>So, some of the challenges in the world today that aligned to the United Nations, SDGs [Sustainable Development Goals] for example, are very difficult problems, and they are stress stretching the boundaries of technology innovation today. I think the Edelman Barometer also found that 59% of people who are thinking about leaving their jobs are doing so for better alignment with their personal values. So having programs like this and activities in your company or in your organization really can impact all of these aspects, not just your P&amp;L. And I think you have to think about it systematically like that.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>And ESG stands for Environmental Social and Governance ideas or aspects, standards, et cetera. And SDG is the UN&#8217;s initiative on Sustainability Development Goals. So, this is a lot because we&#8217;re not actually assigning a dollar amount to what is possible here. It&#8217;s more like if an enterprise wants to be socially conscious, not even socially conscious, just a player and attract the right talent and their customers have trust in them. They really have to invest in other ways of making digital equity real for everyone, maybe not just for their customers, but for tomorrow&#8217;s customers as well.</p>



<p><em>Janice: </em>That&#8217;s right. And so the thing though is it&#8217;s not just a one and done activity, it&#8217;s not like, ‘Oh, I want my company to do better at digital equity. And so let&#8217;s go do this project.’ It really has to be a full-fledged commitment around a culture change or an enhancement to a comprehensive approach around this. And so ways to do this would be, don&#8217;t expect to go too fast. This is a long term, you&#8217;re in it for the long haul. And you&#8217;re really thinking or needing to think across industries with your customers, with your partners, and to really take into account that innovation around achieving digital equity needs to be inclusive in and of itself. So, you can&#8217;t move too fast. You actually need to include those who provide a voice to ideas that maybe you don&#8217;t have.</p>



<p>I think another great comment or slogan from NCWIT is the idea you don&#8217;t have is the voice you haven&#8217;t heard. So how do you hear those voices you haven&#8217;t heard? And how do you learn from the experts or from those you&#8217;re trying to serve and expect you don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know. Expect that you don&#8217;t necessarily have the right awareness necessarily at the ready in your company. And you need to really bring that in so that you have representation to help drive that innovation. And then that innovation will drive inclusivity.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>Yeah. And I think that&#8217;s probably so crucial, especially what we&#8217;ve learned the last few years of the pandemic. If customers don&#8217;t trust brands and employees don&#8217;t trust the company they work for, they&#8217;ll find other opportunities. So, this is a real thing. This is affecting companies’ bottom lines. This is not a touchy-feely, pie in the sky thing, but it is ongoing. As you mentioned, inclusivity changes what&#8217;s possible. That&#8217;s a one-time thing that&#8217;s ongoing, but there are still obstacles. So maybe the first obstacle is just understanding, this is a long process. it&#8217;s ongoing. The company is changing. So digital transformation is important as is digital equity transformation. So, what other things do companies have to think about when they&#8217;re working toward digital equity?</p>



<p><em>Janice: </em>So as I said, I think you have to include voices that you don&#8217;t presently have. You have to have the voice of those you&#8217;re trying to serve in your work on innovation to drive digital equity. You need to build the expectation that this is not a one and done thing. This is a culture shift. This is a long term commitment that has to be in place. And you can&#8217;t go too fast. You can&#8217;t expect that just in let&#8217;s just say, ‘Oh, I&#8217;m going to adopt a new’— let&#8217;s just say, for example, facial recognition technology—’into my application so that I have more awareness.’ Well, you know what, sometimes those technologies don&#8217;t work. We know already that facial recognition technologies, which are rapidly being decommissioned are inherently biased and they&#8217;re not working for all skin tones.</p>



<p>And so that&#8217;s an example of, oh, okay. Somebody had a good idea and maybe a good intention in mind, but it failed miserably in terms of addressing inclusivity and equity. So, expect to iterate, expect that there will be challenges and you have to learn as you go to actually achieve it. But do you have an outcome in mind? Do you have a goal or an objective around equity, are you measuring that in some way, shape or form over the long haul and who are you involving to actually create that? Those are all important considerations to be able to address as you try to achieve digital equity.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>You mentioned the example of using AI to go through screenplays, to point out bias. That must be applicable in a number of different industries. So where else does AI machine learning have such a role for possibility really in digital equity?</p>



<p><em>Janice: </em>Many, many places, certainly a lot of use cases in health care, but one I&#8217;ll add is in agriculture and food systems. So that is a very urgent problem with the growth of the population expected to be over 9 billion by 2050. We are not on track on being able to feed the world. And that&#8217;s tightly complicated by the issues around climate change. So, we&#8217;ve been working with CGIAR, an academic research leader in the world around food systems, and also with a nonprofit called digital green in India, where they&#8217;re working with 2 million farmers in Behar around helping those farmers gain better market information about when to harvest their crops and to understand what the market opportunity is for those crops at the different markets that they&#8217;ve may go to. And so it&#8217;s a great AI problem around weather, transportation, crop type market pricing, and how those figures all come together into the hands of a farmer who can actually decide to harvest or not.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s one example. I think other examples with CGIAR really are around biodiversity and understanding information about what to plant given the changing nature of water and precipitation and soil health and providing those insights and that information in a way that small holder farmers in Africa can actually benefit from that. When to fertilize, when to and where to fertilize, perhaps. Those are all techniques for improving profitability on the part of a small shareholder farmer. And that&#8217;s an example of where AI can do those complicated insights and models over time in concert with weather and climate data to actually make pretty good recommendations that can be useful to these farmers. So, I mean, that&#8217;s an example.</p>



<p>I mean, another example we&#8217;ve been working on is one around disease predictions. So really understanding for certain diseases that are prominent in tropical areas, what are the factors that lead up to an outbreak of a mosquito-borne disease and how can you predict it, or can you predict it well enough in advance of actually being able to take an action or move a therapeutic or an intervention to the area that could be suspect to the outbreak. That&#8217;s another complicated AI problem that hasn&#8217;t been solved today. And those are great ways to address challenges that affect equity and access to treatment, for example.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>And certainly with the capabilities of compute power and AI, we&#8217;re talking about almost real time capabilities versus trying to go back over history of weather maps and much more analog types of ways to deliver and understand information. So, what practical actions can companies take today to address digital equity challenges?</p>



<p><em>Janice: </em>So, I think there are a few things. One is first of all, building your company with an intention to have an equitable inclusive employee population. So first of all the actions you take around hiring, who you mentor, who you help grow and develop in your company are important. And as part of that companies need to showcase role models. It might be a little cliché at this point, but you can&#8217;t be what you can&#8217;t see. And so we know in the world of technology that there haven&#8217;t been a lot of great visible examples of women CIOs or African American CTOs or leaders and engineers doing really cool work that can inspire the next generation of talent to participate. So I think that&#8217;s one thing. So, showcase those role models, invest in describing your efforts in inclusivity and innovation around achieving digital equity.</p>



<p>So really trying to explain how a particular technology innovation is leading to a better outcome around equity and inclusion is just important. So many students choose by the time they are in fifth grade, for example, that technology is boring or that it&#8217;s not for them. It doesn&#8217;t have a human impact that they really desire. And that falls on us. So, we have worked with a program called Curated Pathways to Innovation, which is an online, personalized learning product that&#8217;s free, for schools that is attempting to exactly do that reach middle schoolers before they make that decision that a career in technology is not for them by really helping them improve their awareness and interest in careers and technology, and then help them in a stepwise function in an agency-driven approach, start to prepare for that content and that development around technology.</p>



<p>But you can think about children in the early elementary school days, where they&#8217;re reading books and seeing examples of what does a nurse do? What does a firefighter do? What does a policeman do? Are those kinds of communications and examples available around what does a data scientist do? What does a computer engineer do? What does a cybersecurity professional do? And why is that important and why is that relevant? And I do think we have a lot of work to do as companies and technology to really showcase these examples. I mean, I would argue that technology companies have had the greatest amount of impact on our world globally in the last decade or two than probably any other industry. Yet we don&#8217;t tell that story. And so how do we help connect the dots for students? So, we need to be a voice we need to be visible in developing that interest in the field. And that&#8217;s something that everybody can do right now. So that&#8217;s my two cents on that.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>So, there&#8217;s so much opportunity here, Janice and certainly a lot of responsibility technologists really need to take on. So how do you envision the next two or three years going with digital equity and inclusion? Do you feel like this Clarion bell is just ringing all over the tech industry?</p>



<p><em>Janice: </em>I do. In fact, I see a few key points really, really essential in the future evolution of equity and inclusion. First of all, I think we need to recognize that technology advancements are actually ways that inclusion can be improved and supported. So, it&#8217;s a means to an end. And so recognize that the improvements we make in technology innovations we bring can drive in inclusion more fully. Secondly, I think we need to think about the future of work and where the jobs will be and how they&#8217;ll be developing. We need to think about education as a means to participate in what is and will continue to be the fastest growing sector globally. And that&#8217;s around technology around cyber security, around data science and those career fields. But yet right now some states really don&#8217;t even have high school computer science curriculum in place.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that, but it&#8217;s true. And in some states that do, don&#8217;t give college prep credit for that. And so, if we think the majority of jobs that are going to be created are going to be in the technology sector, in the fields I just described, then we need to ensure that our education system is supporting that in all avenues, in order to address the future of work. First and foremost, it has to start with literacy. We do still have issues around the world and even in the United States around literacy. So, we really have to tackle that at the get go.</p>



<p>The third thing is systems thinking. So, these really tough problems around equity are more than just funding or writing a check to an NGO or doing a philanthropic lunch-packing exercise. Those are all great. I&#8217;m not saying we should stop those, but I actually think we have a lot of expertise in the technology sector around how to partner, how work together, how to think about a system and to allow for outcomes where you bring the individual strengths of all the partners together towards a common outcome.</p>



<p>And I think now more than ever, and then going into the future, being able to build systems of change for inclusion and equity are going to be essential. And then finally, I think the innovation that is being created through the current programs around equity and social impact are really challenging us to think about bigger, better solutions. And I&#8217;m really, really optimistic that these new ideas that can be gained from those working on social innovation and technology innovation for social impact are just going to continue to impress us and to continue to drive solutions to these problems.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>I love that optimism and bigger and better solutions to the problems, that&#8217;s what we all really need to focus on today. Janice, thank you so much for joining us on the Business Lab.</p>

<p>Russia’s war on Ukraine’s cities, civilians, and critical infrastructure has exposed a troubling vulnerability in the escalating conflict: the aging and isolated Ukrainian power sector.</p>



<p>The nation is effectively an energy island after disconnecting from the Belarusian and Russian electricity systems as the invasion began, requiring it to generate nearly all its own electricity. The country relies on four nuclear power plants for <a href="https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/CountryStatistics/CountryDetails.aspx?current=UA">more than half of that</a>. And the largest of them was seized late last week in an assault that ignited a blaze and sparked widespread fears of a potential nuclear accident.</p>



<p>On March 6, the Ukrainian power company DTEK <a href="https://dtek.com/media-center/news/boi-za-svitlo-yak-ukrainska-energosistema-perezhila-10-dniv-viyn/">reported</a> that Russia has begun “targeted destruction” of energy infrastructure in recent days. It noted that a <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/destroyed-power-plant-dismantled-ukrainian-120607567.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGSMie5awIjAC9nUdus1--5Lodp_ogGqT1SF-T_PsktBPgG1zcLd1ph28_iuf98C8f0_PtHlN032zvQGiJ8_xHwmMfQiKsCphW2kA5Obczr-J1YQ4lWCfr7E6MTU2q-QUY35lEzMMfoNuASapB50E0OjnKcvCTfAlVA64A-YOX4g">power plant in Okhtyrka</a> was destroyed, and high-voltage substations in the Donetsk region were hit.</p>



<p>In addition, Russian forces had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-kyiv-hydro/kyiv-hydroelectric-power-plant-controlled-by-russian-troops-ifax-idINS0N2S1022">wrested control</a> of a hydroelectric power plant in Kyiv and appeared to target another in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/russia-ukraine-live-updates-n1290057/ncrd1290083#blogHeader">Nova Kakhovka</a>. They also took over the combined heat and power plant in Luhansk, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/27/business/ukraine-gas-explosion-kharkiv.html">shelled near</a> a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, and shut down electricity and other basic services in several major cities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><strong><em>To support MIT Technology Review&#8217;s journalism, please consider <a href="https://forms.technologyreview.com/subscriptions/">becoming a subscriber</a></em></strong>.</p></blockquote>



<p>Close to a million people don’t have access to electricity in Mariupol and the Kyiv region, DTEK said.</p>



<p>The intensifying assaults have raised fears that Russia could target additional nuclear plants and other major power facilities.</p>



<p>Attacking the energy system is a particularly effective war tactic, producing widespread damage through strikes on relatively small targets, says Adam Stein, associate director for nuclear innovation at the Breakthrough Institute.</p>



<p>And it can have deadly effects amid the nation’s freezing winter temperatures. Even if natural-gas pipelines remain intact, electricity is needed to run pumping stations and the furnaces that heat homes and buildings.</p>



<p>“Let’s not be mistaken: forcing Ukraine’s power plants offline WILL kill civilians,” <a href="https://twitter.com/JesseJenkins/status/1499582659651121157">tweeted</a> Jesse Jenkins, an assistant professor at Princeton who is an expert in energy modeling.</p>



<p>Cutting off electricity can shut down the subways, buses, and trains that citizens are using to flee; flick off the lights in bomb shelters and hospitals; and spoil food and medicine. It also threatens to cut off communications, disrupt government planning, impair military defenses, and undermine morale.</p>



<h3>Synching grids</h3>



<p>As of Sunday, radiation levels remained normal at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, but only two of the six reactors were running, <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/update-13-iaea-director-general-statement-on-situation-in-ukraine">according</a> to the International Atomic Energy Agency. The normal team is still operating the plant, but they’re now doing so “under orders from the commander of the Russian forces” that took control of the site. They’ve also switched off communications lines.</p>



<p>Ukraine has only limited options for bolstering the resiliency of its electricity grid in the middle of a war. DTEK <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-04/ukraine-starts-coal-fired-plants-after-lost-nuclear-output?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=energy&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-energy&amp;sref=E9Urfma4">rapidly turned on</a> nine additional coal turbines last week to compensate for the power lost from the nuclear plant.</p>





<p>But the country’s coal and natural-gas reserves were <a href="https://ukraineverstehen.de/wp-content/uploads/LibMod_Ukraine-winter-energy-outlook-2021-2022_LibMod_final.pdf">already at lower than normal levels</a> this winter. The usual supply lines, from mines to ports, may be constrained, at risk of attacks, or already damaged. Notably, the railway tracks that deliver coal to a separate power plant in Zaporizhzhia were “blown up,” DTEK noted.</p>



<p>Filling in for the output of a nuclear plant will rapidly drain reserves, says Georg Zachmann, a senior fellow at the economic think tank Bruegel, who focuses on Ukrainian energy issues.</p>



<p>Officials and energy executives in the nation are <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-moldova-seeks-connection-to-eu-electricity-grid/">pushing for</a> another possibility: rapidly integrating the country’s grid with the European Union’s system to enable electricity to flow in, particularly in the event of sudden or broader outages.</p>



<p>That effort was already underway. In 2017, the country’s main transmission operator, Ukrenergo, signed a connection agreement with ENTSO-E, Europe’s association of more than 40 transmission operators. But the integration would require installation of frequency control capabilities and other technology to ensure the grids can interoperate, as well as extensive system safety tests and a variety of complex regulatory and power market agreements.</p>



<p>A full integration would also necessitate turning on or building transmission lines through Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, Zachmann noted in <a href="https://www.lowcarbonukraine.com/wp-content/uploads/Synchronising-Ukraine%C2%B4s-and-Europe%C2%B4s-electricity-grids.pdf">an analysis</a> last year. Those would collectively deliver more than five gigawatts of electricity, exceeding 10% of Ukraine’s normal generation capacity, the level required by the EU and ENTSO-E for such cross-border integrations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="3000" height="1688" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/T1P094-crop-1.jpeg?w=3000" alt="UKRENERGO NPC SE in Kiev" class="wp-image-1046834" srcset="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/T1P094-crop-1.jpeg 3000w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/T1P094-crop-1.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/T1P094-crop-1.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/T1P094-crop-1.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/T1P094-crop-1.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" /><figcaption>The Kiev headquarters of Ukrenergo, the Ukraine power company lobbying to integrate its grid with the European Union system.</figcaption><div class="image-credit">PAVLO BALANENKO/ALAMY</div>
</figure>



<p>All of that was expected to cost at least €600 million and take years to complete.</p>



<p>The hope now is that the parties could synchronize the systems in “<a href="https://www.icis.com/explore/resources/news/2022/03/03/10740084/ukraine-eu-power-grid-sync-could-happen-next-week-dtek/">emergency mode</a>,” potentially within days or weeks, by dropping some of the usual requirements and agreements. The limited integration might tap into lines already connecting Ukraine with Hungary and Slovakia, Zachmann says.</p>



<p>EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson said there’s broad agreement on moving forward “as quickly as possible,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-eu-energy-idAFS8N2UE03P">Reuters reported</a>.</p>



<p>But there could still be some significant technical and political challenges that hold up the integration. Late last month, ENTSO-E <a href="https://www.entsoe.eu/news/2022/02/28/28-february-2022-request-for-emergency-synchronisation-of-ukrainian-power-system-to-continental-europe-power-system/">said</a> its transmission operators would “urgently assess” the options and make the effort a “matter of priority.” But it hasn’t provided details on the current state of the undertaking or announced the estimated timing.</p>



<p>In response to an MIT Technology Review inquiry, the press office said that its experts are assessing different options and must take into account technical considerations, system stability, regulatory issues, and cybersecurity concerns.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Across industries and geographies, the pandemic has triggered a paradigm shift in the way companies—and their employees—conduct day-to-day business. The move to work-from-home and hybrid work models has increased the need for collaboration to facilitate communication and innovation from remote locations, and to keep teams connected and engaged when in-person meetings are difficult or impossible.</p>



<p>Successful collaboration requires creating an equitable experience for all team members, says Faiza Hughell, RingCentral&#8217;s chief customer officer. “Participant equity is predicated on the ability to empower your employees with the tools, technologies, and programs they need to reach success, to remain productive at all times,” she explains.</p>



<p>And it’s more important than ever for companies to evaluate the new technologies teams are implementing to ensure they are facilitating the desired outcomes, as well as to assess a particular technology’s potential application to other areas and teams in the company. “In a sales organization, for example, certain teams may have access to certain tools that increase their productivity. Well guess what? Other teams might be able to benefit from that as well,” says Hughell. “It&#8217;s important when we bring in new technologies that we negotiate our contracts such that they&#8217;re flexible, so we can determine who needs the technology.”</p>



<p>When evaluating new technologies to drive and support distributed workforces, Hughell suggests paring up individuals, which not only helps people learn, but drives adoption of the new technology and helps the company assess whether it’s bringing the expected results. “I always tell my leaders inspect what you expect. Don&#8217;t just buy a piece of technology, roll it out and expect miracles to happen,” she says. “You have to drive adoption and usage, and you might find that it was the wrong technology and it&#8217;s not serving your desired outcome or purpose, at which point, make that decision as a leader to fast fail and move on.”</p>



<p>The most important best practice is to do what’s necessary to empower your employees to succeed. Providing libraries of bite-size instruction videos, for instance, can help team members learn specific features of new technology related to their work, without having to sit through long training sessions. Creating the atmosphere of learning and collaboration is as important to a company’s success as implementing the new technology. “At the end of the day,” says Hughell, “if you can show someone that you&#8217;re going to help empower their success and help increase their productivity and reduce friction in their day-to-day operation, not many people would argue with that.”</p>

<h3><strong>Full transcript</strong></h3>



<p><em>Laurel Ruma: </em>From MIT Technology Review, I&#8217;m Laurel Ruma and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace. Our topic today is building a culture of collaboration and innovation. Regardless of where your employees and customers are located, the pandemic has highlighted the need for all employees to collaborate, contribute, and innovate everywhere, and the same proves true for customers as more companies move to a hybrid workforce model, but the need for communication increases.</p>



<p>Two words for you: collaboration first.</p>



<p>My guest is Faiza Hughell, who is RingCentral&#8217;s chief customer officer.</p>



<p>This episode of Business Lab is produced in association with RingCentral.</p>



<p>Welcome Faiza.</p>



<p><em>Faiza Hughell: </em>Thank you so much for having me.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>As a chief customer officer at RingCentral, how do you define your role in the organization and in industry as a whole?</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>I define the role of a chief customer officer as one that serves both customers and employees. It&#8217;s a critical role, as I think tying the needs, the desires of the customer, to the innovation and the strategies and the go-forward plans of any organization, are critical to any company&#8217;s success. All the while being mindful that every company&#8217;s success is also predicated on happy, enthusiastic, eager, and hungry employees.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>I like to say technology is easy, it&#8217;s people that are hard. How do people, employees, and customers alike need to change the way that they think to focus on collaborating online first? What are the benefits?</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>Absolutely, great question. I&#8217;ve been a collaboration leader for almost 30 years, selling communication, collaboration technologies, and the one thing I found, and I think this is regardless of what role you serve in any organization or even in life for that matter, is that life is very situational. People are very situational. And it&#8217;s so important, especially now in this environment, to handle things on a case-by-case situation. Someone may be dealing with a challenge because it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s new to them. They may be a star in other areas of their work or their business, but they might be facing a challenge that&#8217;s brand new, and you really have to coach and manage to that specific situation and keep the conversation focused on the desired outcome. In doing that, your employees, your customers feel that they&#8217;ve been heard, they feel that they&#8217;ve been supported and they don&#8217;t feel less than. I think that&#8217;s an important thing in today&#8217;s environment.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>Yeah. Especially in the context of the pandemic, we have found ourselves in these situations, whether it&#8217;s a doorbell ringing or a child crying, our days are not the same as they used to be. Those hungry employees, they&#8217;re excited, ready to work for the customers and have great outcomes, but it&#8217;s not always so easy now.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>Yeah. In fact, I think it&#8217;s a lot more difficult to access people, to access technologies, to access programs, to get people to be together. Gone are the days of just walking to Bill&#8217;s office to say, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got an issue.&#8221; Now you&#8217;ve got to track Bill down virtually.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>So, when we think about the move to hybrid work, and this does seem to be quite a shift in the way that companies are working now, there&#8217;s a different set of challenges, especially making sure that all employees have equal access to communication and collaboration platforms. RingCentral calls this “participant equity.” Could you tell us more about this idea?</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>Participant equity is really predicated on the ability to empower your employees with the tools that they need, the technologies they need, the programs that they need, to reach success, to remain productive at all times. And I&#8217;ll tell you, it’s important—I’ve seen it firsthand. I&#8217;ll give you an example: in a sales organization, certain teams may have access to certain tools that really increase their productivity. Well guess what? Other teams might be able to benefit from that as well. It&#8217;s really important when we bring in new technologies that we negotiate our contracts such that they&#8217;re flexible. So we can determine who needs the technology, who&#8217;s not needing the technology.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>And we usually track that through usage at RingCentral. I can actually see who&#8217;s using what, and if it&#8217;s beneficial to them. I like to really dive down and swim with my fish. It&#8217;s the only way to know what&#8217;s happening with the current and understand how are these technologies empowering your success? How are you using them? And I like to pair those people with other people in the organization who may not be seeing that same benefit so they can get mentored and coached and hey, look, if it doesn&#8217;t work, it doesn&#8217;t work. Not all technologies are one size fits all.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>Yeah. And that&#8217;s a really good way of framing it, too. It&#8217;s not like everyone&#8217;s looking to see what you&#8217;re doing and how much time you&#8217;re spending on various programs or platforms. It&#8217;s really just to maximize people&#8217;s effectiveness and, as you said, to improve in areas where we may not be as strong. And so having that ability to look at a platform and a number of different usage stats to bring people together certainly does not just benefit each individual, but the organization overall.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>Oh, absolutely. And I have found at times that we&#8217;ve deployed technologies that we&#8217;ve invested greatly in and only a third of the population are using it through these brown bag lunch sessions. Through partnering and pairing people up, we&#8217;ve gotten usage to increase and, therefore, productivity increases. And our outcome, our goals are achieved as a byproduct of that motion. So it&#8217;s really important. I always tell my leaders inspect what you expect. Don&#8217;t just buy a piece of technology, roll it out, and expect miracles to happen. You have to drive adoption and usage, and you might find that it was the wrong technology and it&#8217;s not serving your desired outcome or purpose—at which point, make that decision as a leader to fast fail and move on.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>Oh, that&#8217;s great advice there. So what are some of those best practices that teams can deploy for creating that equitable experience, whether it&#8217;s a brown bag lunch or something else?</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>I think in addition to sharing the best practices, it&#8217;s really important that people have different modes of learning. I&#8217;ve got a handful of reps in my team that don&#8217;t necessarily have the bandwidth or time to sit through multiple-hour, live, in-person or instructor-led sessions. Sometimes people miss those training sessions, too. So, it&#8217;s so important that you manage your content. When you&#8217;re rolling out some new technology, do have that live training, do record that training, and break it down into some small bite-size pieces of things you know people might struggle with the most, rather than having to go back and listen to a whole two-hour session.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>Create a library that your employees can go access, like a two-minute sound bite on something specific, a specific feature within the technology. And you&#8217;ll find that people are more likely to adapt to it. It&#8217;s just like customers: you sell to customers the way they want to buy, you service customers the way they need to be served. Well, that same approach has to be applied to the employee as well. You have to make sure you&#8217;re creating an atmosphere where it&#8217;s conducive to all styles and modes of learning and allows them to get information quickly without having to look in a million different places and invest a great deal of time.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>Yeah. And that&#8217;s for on-the-spot learning and needs. How do you inspire that innovation spirit as well in these collaboration platforms?</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>I think it&#8217;s about storytelling. Just like when I was in sales, we would do a lot of storytelling to customers, sharing how the RingCentral platform has empowered our other customer success. Would you like to learn about doing that within your business? It&#8217;s how you bring the value. You have to bring your value to your customers, and you have to bring the value to your employees as well. It&#8217;s the old “what&#8217;s in it for me.” And I think in today&#8217;s world where people are moving so fast and there&#8217;s so much opportunity at everybody&#8217;s fingertips, you really have to hone in on why it matters and why should it be important and why should it be prioritized.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>At the end of the day, if you can show someone that you&#8217;re going to help empower their success and help increase their productivity and reduce friction in their day-to-day operation, not many people would argue with that. And I think we forget sometimes that even as employees, there might be 10 tools you can use. Some people prefer an old-fashioned method, some people are really tech savvy and quick adopters. Again, it becomes situational. You&#8217;ve got to be able to manage the two different classes of individuals.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>So, when we talk about innovation with customers, do you have an example or two of how customers are working in different ways with collaboration platforms?</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>Absolutely. So, I&#8217;ve been selling collaboration and communication for over 28 years. I have seen a lot of different ways, but most recently I launched a customer gratitude series over the Thanksgiving holiday, just an opportunity to put some spotlight on my customers and the great work they&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s really amazing to see how people have pivoted to collaboration technology. We were in a customer advisory board meeting with Fire Medical, one of my customers, talking about how they were leveraging RingCentral video to help provide training for the respiratory equipment. Especially in this pandemic world, with all the people that have gotten deathly ill around us, stopping business operations for a company like that is just a disgusting thought.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>However, it was a really rewarding feeling to hear about how they were able to pivot from in-person training on their medical devices and equipment to training virtually via RingCentral video. That company did not miss a beat. They were able to move to a work-from-home environment, with zero interruption to their business, and they were able to serve their customers and get that medical equipment out and ensure their customers and end users were trained on how to use those devices. And it gives me goosebumps to think about how many lives were saved because of this company and their use of this technology. It&#8217;s a humbling experience when you hear those stories.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>Yeah. And I think we, especially during the pandemic, think about the need and perhaps have always thought, well, health care and the pharmaceutical industries have been a bit behind all the fast-moving tech, and how can we move everything faster, but to be fair, this is a very high-touch industry that has protocols, needs, and regulations all in place. And to find a way to actually shift that so quickly to have everything online is actually quite an accomplishment. And although we see that as maybe an innovation that was in years in the making, they still had to do it, and as you said, pivot, and then succeed with it. So, it&#8217;s not just one part of the equation; it&#8217;s really all of those pieces coming together.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>Absolutely.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>So, we sort of have that internal experience with innovation and how we can help folks collaborate and communicate better inside of a company. And then we have the ability for various customer do excellent things with innovation. How does customer experience also evolve and improve with these kinds of collaboration platforms?</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>That&#8217;s a great question. We&#8217;ve been deploying a lot of things here at RingCentral to make sure that we&#8217;re able to cast a wide net and meet all of our customer needs and demands, especially in the height of the pandemic, where companies were having to pivot to full work-from-home environments. You can only imagine the number of questions they had. In fact, I&#8217;ve been talking to a lot of customers who&#8217;ve recently deployed our contact center technologies, and the feedback I&#8217;m getting is how blown away they are at the benefits that they&#8217;ve seen from productivity gains, being able to manage with good, intelligent data and reporting, the productivity of their employees during a business day, and their takeaway is that, wow, we deployed this because of having to pivot to work from home. However, we realized now we needed this all along; these technologies are super powerful.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>So, I think collaboration comes in many forms across all of our platforms here at RingCentral. It&#8217;s not just video and video collaboration. While I will say it&#8217;s been so fun to take part in some of the customer and employee sessions that have taken place, to continue to keep culture and energy alive and empowering that human connection via video has been amazing. But our other technologies and the stories I hear from customers and how they&#8217;re collaborating using our other technologies, such as our contact center or messaging platform, have been really refreshing as well. A lot of companies have pivoted to really an immersive experience in the full unified communications platform that RingCentral offers. In fact, I was speaking to a customer yesterday. They participated in our Small Business School Challenge. When the pandemic hit, RingCentral stood up a lot of programs to help our small and medium-size business (SMB) customers.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>22% of SMBs had to permanently close their doors in the height of the pandemic. And we tried our very best to help empower our customers and ensure that they were able to continue business operations. One thing we did is we launched the Small Business School Challenge, where we were pairing our small business customers with MBA grads from reputable universities to help pivot their business and strategies. Catching up with one of those customers who participated in that event yesterday, he has actually instituted some permanent practice in his small business, leveraging online stores, leveraging QR codes, where people can scan a QR code to schedule a virtual meeting using RingCentral video, a meeting that would&#8217;ve otherwise been something that they would&#8217;ve walked into their storefront for. It&#8217;s really, really cool to see. In fact, he&#8217;s shared with me since the big hit in 2020, fast forward to now, his business has grown tremendously as a result of that.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>And I couldn&#8217;t put any more emphasis on the importance of innovation. He was open-minded. He was willing to try new things. He was willing to pivot some strategies, and he&#8217;s now, fast forward, operating his business in what I would consider a hybrid format. His old brick-and-mortar business practice of people coming into his storefront, married now with virtual meetings, and he&#8217;s able to serve more customers as a result of it. So, his business actually grew as a result of that innovation and the leveraging of these different platforms.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>I think everyone loves hearing those types of stories of how people and companies have come through this. And I&#8217;m glad you mentioned SMB, the small and medium-size businesses, because it is one of those areas that obviously were hit very hard during the pandemic, but people tend to maybe overlook like, oh, what could you possibly be doing for innovation as a small business? But that is a very good example of something that actually happened, and the results are tangible. What other kinds of interesting and surprising pivots did you see?</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>I touched on contact center earlier; that seemed to be the most popular one as I set out to reach out to and connect with customers of all sizes over the last few months. Companies like the likes of Medifast all the way through World Vision—I&#8217;ve done a ton of interviews. I even interviewed a customer recently whose organization puts on dog shows and taking those live, in-person dog shows and those events that people loved and looked forward to, for all those fur lovers out there, and taking that online and seeing a great deal of success. So, whether it be medical equipment, whether it be dog shows, whether it be humanitarian efforts, I&#8217;ve seen all different customers of RingCentral make some serious pivots over the last 12 to 24 months. And it&#8217;s really, really refreshing to see the innovation that&#8217;s gone on there. And just how deeply RingCentral&#8217;s technology has empowered their success to do business in new ways.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>We joke here internally in my organization, &#8220;I survived a meeting that could have been a message.&#8221; You have to have a balance. Certain things can&#8217;t be done via instant messenger, or certain things can&#8217;t be done via phone calls. Sometimes you really have to have a meeting, share screens, look at content together, and come to decisions. However, how many times have we all sat in a meeting for an hour that could have just been a quick exchange of messages? So, I really encourage people to just take a moment of pause and think about the desired outcome, the situation, what the problem is, what are you trying to tackle, and really put some thought into what flavor or mode of communication you really want to take to make sure that you can solve that problem, you can get through that collaboration effectively and move forward.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>I sit through a lot of group messages in our messaging platform, and I&#8217;m constantly finding myself having to say, &#8220;Team, this should be a meeting or a live discussion. You&#8217;re not going to solve it here.&#8221; And it&#8217;s funny because I think over messaging, people want to do it because it&#8217;s fast, and that&#8217;s great, but sometimes fast isn&#8217;t the right approach. You really have to put more thought into it, and that requires deeper collaboration. So, part of me really has always been in love with RingCentral because it&#8217;s empowered my life as a working parent. I&#8217;m always on the go. I love the fact that I can be sitting here in a conversation like this with you today. I can flip to my mobile device, throw it on mute, if I had to, cook something for my son real quick, run back upstairs.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>I think as parents, we&#8217;re all finding ourselves in these unique situations. Sometimes you&#8217;re in a video meeting and it runs long. I can turn off the camera, I can flip it to my mobile device, make it to the school to pick up my son and be back home, and no one knows, and I haven&#8217;t missed a beat, and I&#8217;ve been connected. Right now, I think the way the world is operating, we&#8217;re having to stretch ourselves in ways we wouldn&#8217;t have imagined otherwise. And with the right technology, with the right innovation and the right collaboration, it&#8217;s possible.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>While, I&#8217;m excited about this, I do like to remind people, especially those working parents out there, don&#8217;t forget to take care of you and get some self-time in there. Self-care time is so important, and you&#8217;ve got to balance it all some way, somehow. And it&#8217;s a trying time, I think, for us also. I&#8217;ve been encouraging people to, while you&#8217;re leveraging those collaboration and collaborative technologies, while you&#8217;re driving innovation in this hybrid world, make sure that you&#8217;re taking some pause and some time for self-care as well.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>Absolutely. And perhaps that would come in the form of watching a dog show. So how can emerging technologies, because as you said, we&#8217;re talking about innovation and this is certainly a new technology to some folks, and other folks have been part of this world and this process for a long time, but emerging technologies like chatbots and artificial intelligence, how are those playing a role in collaboration platforms and call centers to help customers find those efficiencies, save time, and save money?</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>As I move forward in 2022 for my own organization, I&#8217;m really focusing on three imperatives. I actually took this from a BCG, Boston Consulting Group, article recently about embedded structural resilience. Understanding the potential service request along two dimensions. You&#8217;ve got the predictability of demand, which is the volume of service requests that come into an organization, and then you&#8217;ve got to also manage that in conjunction with the complexity of resolution. So you have to consider business continuity, you have to consider global scale, and again, customers want to buy the way they want to buy, and they want to be served the way they need to be served. So, how do you get a preemptive and responsive model working congruently? It&#8217;s interesting because as I do research on this, I found for higher complexity requests, that when they call into service organizations, 45% of call time is considered dead air; it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s a complex thing. Your agents are having to go find information.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>So, how do you solve for that? Well, you solve for that by arming your agents with bionic capabilities. You really have to augment with these bionic capabilities, invest deeply in their enablement, make sure that they&#8217;re trained to handle complex situations. And then you leverage AI technologies, automation, and self-service technologies to really augment the less complex needs through modes of self-service. So, I&#8217;ve been deploying a lot of chatbots and self-service tools here at RingCentral myself. I want to put information at my customer&#8217;s hands in as real time as possible. If they have a simple need, they have a simple question, I want that information at their fingertips. We live in a self-service world. Who doesn&#8217;t want to just self-serve? We&#8217;d all prefer it. When you go to the movie theater nowadays, you don&#8217;t wait in line to talk to the gentleman or the young lady behind the counter.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>You go to the teller and you swipe your credit card and you say, &#8220;I need four tickets to <em>Sing 2</em>,&#8221; and you get your tickets and you enter the movie theater. It&#8217;s just the world we live in. My Costco recently put in some self-service lines, and I was thrilled. I am that person who can go to Costco and buy only two things, if you can believe it, and I don&#8217;t want to wait in long lines where people have those big, giant carts stacked to the top with things. I love being able to breeze through that self-service line. So, the same with technologies and technology buyers. It&#8217;s all about automation through digital self-service, augmenting your team with bionic capabilities so they can really, really focus in on the more complex strategic needs of the customer. And that allows us at the end of the day, to flex our human capacity with new workforce models, and that&#8217;s become even more important in today&#8217;s world.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>I have a small confession here. I worked for a time in a call center, helping customers plan their European travel by train. So, I can attest to that dead air as I scrambled to look up schedules and maps and timetables for everyone to get to where they needed to go. And that opportunity for self-service is just so empowering, as you said, for the customer themselves. But it also helps the agent to know that when a call does come through, they can help in the absolute best way possible because they know this person has most likely looked at all other opportunities and they just kind of need that one-on-one help. I feel that can be a lot more satisfaction for even the people working in the call centers because you&#8217;re at a higher level of service as well.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>Absolutely. I&#8217;d love to quote some stats from this article, if you don&#8217;t mind.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>Sure.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>They say here that companies report by implementing these AI-driven knowledge-based tools, they&#8217;ve improved their first contact resolution by 5 to 7%, reduced call handling time by 20%, and reduced new hire training by 25 to 40%. And I&#8217;m seeing that myself as I&#8217;m deploying these different tools as well. It&#8217;s interesting. I&#8217;ve deployed a lot of self-service tools, which means my less complex situations are now being handled through our knowledge base. Our customers are able to access that information themselves. So, I&#8217;m actually seeing my first call resolution not go up, but it&#8217;s going down slightly, and that&#8217;s actually a good thing. Some people might panic about that; I&#8217;m not. It means that the self-service tools I&#8217;ve implemented are working, and my team is now handling the more complex cases that require a little bit more time for resolution.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>And that&#8217;s the balance that I was really trying to strike, was rather than hiring, I have a huge call center of support agents, rather than adding hundreds or thousands more agents, can I offset with some self-service tools? Put information in real time in customers’ hands and empower the 2,000-plus agents I have to just deal one on one with customers, give them the due attention they need to really solve the more complex issues. The answer is, yes, it&#8217;s working brilliantly. I&#8217;m only a quarter in on this journey and I am so thrilled with the results I&#8217;m seeing early in the game. I get goosebumps thinking about what this is going to look like a year from now. I can&#8217;t wait to see it come to fruition.</p>



<p><em>Laurel: </em>Oh, that&#8217;s excellent. Speaking of future looking, how are you advising customers to think about collaboration and innovation in the next couple, two or three years?</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>Yeah. It&#8217;s interesting; it&#8217;s a great question. So, RingCentral has always been the work-from-anywhere company pre-pandemic. I myself have been a hybrid employee since 2015. Our taglines have always been work from anywhere, on any mode, in any device. I can&#8217;t tell you how many meetings I&#8217;ve joined from mountaintops, lakeside, beachside. I&#8217;m an avid traveler. I&#8217;ve loved RingCentral&#8217;s technology because it&#8217;s empowered my personal life. But I think as we move forward, people will take some of this with them. So, it&#8217;s a really important time to make sure that we continue to put the right technologies in people&#8217;s hands. We continue to empower them, but also leverage it to power that human connection. It&#8217;s really hard. I think we can all agree to team build, to bond, to build culture in this environment.</p>



<p><em>Faiza: </em>We can&#8217;t lose sight of that. I really encourage people to stay close to it. I recently participated in a virtual charades game with one of our teams. It was really a lot of fun. We enjoyed ourselves. It&#8217;s something that even as we move forward, I&#8217;ve been thinking about. If tomorrow everything were to open back up and go back to in person, nothing ever was truly in person, if you think about it. You always had some remote employees. And there were always moments where somebody might be left out of something because they live in Nebraska or they live in Illinois. Now I&#8217;ve come to find that there&#8217;s so many other things we could have been doing to include those people in these team building and culture building activities for employees. So I&#8217;d say, it&#8217;s important to keep both moving forward. It&#8217;s an interesting time, it really is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Targeted ads follow us around the internet, pitching us everything from meme-based T-shirts to Mahabis slippers wherever we go. Now the power of tracking pixels and pop-up ads is being used to try to tell ordinary Russians what’s really happening during the invasion of Ukraine.</p>



<p>“We’ve seen the powerful role that civil society can play in telling the story of Ukraine, advocating for its interests, and rallying international support,” says Jack Pearson, a foreign policy communications specialist who previously worked for the UK Foreign Office specializing in digital diplomacy. “Now we’re seeing efforts from communities around the world to break the Kremlin’s information stranglehold, to reach ordinary Russians.”</p>



<p>Reliable news is hard to get in Russia at the moment. State news outlets are telling viewers that the invasion is a defensive move, while independent Russian stations like <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/03/russia-blocks-tv-rain-its-last-independent-tv-channel-and-tv-rain-airs-its-last-broadcast/">TV Rain</a> are being shut down at the behest of authorities. Meanwhile, international press organizations such as the BBC and Voice of America have been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/russia-restricts-access-bbc-russian-service-radio-liberty-ria-2022-03-04/">blocked</a>. To fill the information void, a small army of activists are exploiting holes in the Russian firewall. In so doing, they’re trying to provide a modicum of fact in a Russian media ecosystem that is increasingly untethered from the truth.</p>



<p>The activists puncturing holes in Russia’s propaganda machine are taking any opportunity they can. Users of the Russian pharmacy chain Ozerki’s app received push notifications overnight on February 28 telling them to “wake up” to Vladimir Putin’s attempt to steal the lives of Russian soldiers, alongside the Russian population’s money, by sending his countrymen to war. The chain <a href="https://www.fontanka.ru/2022/03/01/70478612/">later said</a> it had been the victim of a hack. </p>



<p>Digital campaigners have been <a href="https://twitter.com/maxfras/status/1498595355763617792">bombarding Yandex</a>, the Russian equivalent of Google, with falsified reviews of major locations in the country that spread the truth about Putin’s incursion into Ukraine. One Ukraine-born, America-based academic has <a href="http://deryugina.com/a-view-from-russian-academia/">emailed thousands</a> of her Russian colleagues to let them know what’s going on in her homeland at their army’s hands.</p>



<p>New Now, a Web design agency in Berlin, has posted a <a href="https://github.com/NewNowCool/help-the-ukraine-now">web script on GitHub</a> that will <a href="https://twitter.com/newnow_/status/1499419360129163268">push a pop-up</a> onto any web page where the script is included, telling those accessing the website from a Russian IP that their government is lying to them, and that innocent people and children are being killed.</p>



<p>“This whole thing, from a development point of view, is super simple,” says Kai Nicolaides of New Now, who wrote the script. He came up with the idea when seeing the sources of traffic to the websites of personal projects he ran. “Those projects might not be blocked for Russian visitors, because they’re not significant enough from an information point of view,” he says. </p>



<p>“We’re not a foreign news source or anything—they’re just fun projects.” The concept was to raise awareness for those who have no idea of what’s going on—and to prompt those who do know to think a little deeper. “We thought most Russians will know something is fishy, but maybe there are a few who will need a nudge,” says Nicolaides. “We thought we could start this grassroots movement.”</p>



<p>The canny tricks to put chinks in the Russian state narrative about Ukraine also include placing online ads that aim to tell the truth about what’s going on.</p>





<p>London marketing and communications professional Rob Blackie is crowdfunding targeted ads that are designed to funnel Russian readers to independent Russian-language news sources about the Ukraine conflict. He is—he admits—taking advantage of the fact that “the digital ad land has been until recently a total Wild West.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He first tested the method in 2014, when Russia captured Crimea from Ukraine under another false pretext. He used location targeting to send ads to people living in Sevastopol, the largest city in Crimea, and show them news of the Russian invasion. It ended up in front of 1,000 pairs of eyeballs. It was a very small experiment, but it showed he was able to penetrate the Russian firewall of fake news.</p>



<p>Today, he’s working with around 20 fellow ad professionals in the UK on a larger-scale campaign that launched on February 27. “Our basic concept is find loopholes in the system, deliver those ads into Russia, and those ads will link people to independent news websites showing people news about what’s going on in Ukraine,” he says.</p>



<p>The team has been playing cat and mouse with both digital censors in Russia and the platforms through which the ads are served, both of which are highly alert to information that they want to restrict—accurate facts about the invasion in Russia’s case, and inaccurate pro-Russia narratives for the platforms. </p>



<p>One set of ads was banned overnight on March 3, according to Blackie, who refuses to share information about where and how the team is placing them. “I can’t talk about platforms other than to say we’re trying everything we can think of,” he says. He equates it to his day job working on marketing for biotech companies, one of which saw a positive ad promoting news of a covid vaccine breakthrough banned because of an overly censorious dragnet trying to stop anti-vax ads. “What we know from our experience is it’s possible to get around those rules if you’re determined and you don’t mind breaching Russian law,” he says.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><strong><em>To support MIT Technology Review&#8217;s journalism, please consider <a href="https://forms.technologyreview.com/subscriptions/">becoming a subscriber</a></em></strong>.</p></blockquote>



<p>The UK ad campaign is sending Russian recipients to “four or five” URLs of independent websites covering Ukraine in the Russian language, specifically chosen in the hope that it’ll encourage them to return to the site day after day, undermining the Kremlin’s official narrative. But social media isn’t the only forum for such activity. </p>



<p>“In the modern world there are a lot of places you can advertise, and we’re trying a lot of those,” he says, claiming that if he could find a way to access digital ad billboards on the Moscow Metro, he’d try seeding information there: “We’ve got a lot of experts who have devious brains trying to get around the rules.”</p>



<p>He has only <a href="https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/give-russians-real-news-about-ukraine-using-ads">raised £18,500</a> ($24,500) so far,&nbsp; but the campaign has already reached 2<a href="https://twitter.com/robblackie_oo/status/1499468810214072325"> million people</a>, with 42,000 clicking through to websites it promotes. <a href="https://twitter.com/robblackie_oo/status/1499670375713673217">More than 100,000 ads</a> were served in the first nine hours of March 4, despite bans on some key terms used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blackie is far from the only person harnessing online advertising’s ability to pinpoint specific users within Russia to raise awareness of the country’s aggressions. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=RU&amp;q=ukraine&amp;sort_data%5bdirection%5d=desc&amp;sort_data%5bmode%5d=relevancy_monthly_grouped&amp;search_type=keyword_unordered&amp;media_type=all">More than 1,300 ads mentioning “Ukraine”</a> are currently running on Facebook and Instagram targeting users based in Russia. (A further <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=RU&amp;q=%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0&amp;sort_data%5bdirection%5d=desc&amp;sort_data%5bmode%5d=relevancy_monthly_grouped&amp;search_type=keyword_unordered&amp;media_type=all">1,100 are running using “Украина,”</a> the Cyrillic version of “Ukraine,” though that includes many innocuous ads picturing cats.) While Facebook isn’t as dominant in Russia as VK, the homegrown alternative, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/867549/top-active-social-media-platforms-in-russia/">four in 10 Russians</a> reportedly use it, while six in 10 are on Instagram.</p>





<p>Many of the ads are run by the “news and media website” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ukraine.war.is/">Ukraine War</a>, while others are run by the “social media agency” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Safe-Ukraine-100242772615466/">Safe Ukraine</a>. They include <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=375271207772998">emotive videos</a> of captured Russian soldiers tearfully calling their parents back home to reveal the reality of what war is like, alongside text exhorting Russians to speak out against the war. The project is run by Bohdana, a 33-year-old from the northwest Ukrainian city of Lutsk, who declined to share her surname.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another grassroots campaign is organized by the Ukrainian arm of the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB). “We try to give more information about the real situation, because there’s very strict control on information in Russia, and there’s no independent media,” says Anastasiya Baydachenko, IAB Ukraine’s chief executive.</p>



<p>For the first week of the war, the Ukrainian advertising industry’s campaign has operated largely on Google’s advertising network—though it recently hit the buffers with the request by Roskomnadzor, the Russian state media regulator, to stop spreading what Russia deemed “disinformation” about its activities in Russia. On March 4, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-pauses-all-ad-sales-russia-2022-03-04/">Google acceded to that request</a>, temporarily halting the ability to book ads in Russia. &#8220;The situation is evolving quickly,” the company said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That action has scuppered some of the IAB-backed group’s plans. However, Baydachenko claims that Roskomnadzor’s decision to crack down on ads is a sign of the IAB campaign’s effectiveness.</p>



<p>The campaign, in which a large number of different accounts had each spent small amounts of money with Google to target demographics likely to include the mothers of Russian soldiers, will now port to Yandex. “We understand using Yandex is high risk because of its control,” she says. “That’s why it’s a long shot—but we’ll try to do it to build reach for our messages.”</p>



<p>Baydachenko says there are around four or five other Ukrainian initiatives operated by groups that independently set up in the first days of the war. “We’re all trying to reach Russian audiences with different messages,” she says.</p>



<p>The IAB’s campaign is funded by private companies as well as by donations and sponsors, who are willing to plow large sums into trying to get across the horrors of what’s going on in Ukraine at the hands of Vladimir Putin’s army. “The owners of Ukrainian businesses understand we have a crisis here,” says Baydachenko. “They are willing to spend $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, or $50,000 in order to communicate and bring information to Russia.”</p>



<p>Altogether, Baydachenko estimates, 10 million hryvnia ($330,000) has been spent on Ukraine-based ad campaigns trying to get more honest information into Russia in the last week. All of them are what Agnes Venema, a national security and intelligence academic at the University of Malta, calls “the 2022 version of the underground newspaper.” “People have found out that they can beat Putin at his own game by countering the disinformation in a way that allows any Russian with an internet connection to see it,” she says.</p>





<p>Yet despite the vast amounts being spent, some worry it’ll be ineffectual. “I think the ads are a waste,” says Steven Buckley, who studies social media and politics at the University of the West of England. “Many will have ad blockers, and the click-through rate on such ads are very low.” Buckley believes that Nicolaides’s script to pop up a notification seems most likely to succeed—but the Russian government could step in to block it. </p>



<p>Another approach would be direct emails to Russian addresses, perhaps including links to sites like the BBC, which has <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCTech/status/1499693576342622209">started more prominently pushing a dark web mirror</a> that’s been accessible since 2019. However, such emails could be blocked by spam filters. Venema also cautions against assuming that any digital campaign will be a magic bullet. </p>



<p>“Russian disinformation has been so indoctrinating that I’m not sure how much of a difference a few ads will make,” she says. “In many ways, Russians are living a conspiracy theory, and we know that it is very hard to break free from that.”</p>



<p>Others are more confident that any action, no matter how small, can make a difference. “These sorts of people-to-people interactions could prove to be incredibly powerful if they can be sustained and scaled,” says Pearson. “Reaching ordinary Russians is, however, just one challenge. The cost of dissent in Russia is extremely high and getting higher.”</p>



<p>As for those involved, the alternative—doing nothing—wasn’t an option. “I just thought, what other ways are there to do some digital activism?” says Nicolaides. “What are the means I have currently? Where can I make even the slightest difference? It could be a drop in a huge bucket of water—but every drop counts in the end.”</p>

<p>The market for NFTs—tokens that represent digital art, music, videos, and the like—soared last year to <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/nft-market-report-preview-2021/">$44 billion</a>. This brought a lot of attention to Ethereum, the blockchain network where most NFTs are bought and sold. It also brought a lot of attention to something else: the massive energy wastefulness of cryptocurrency mining.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchains don’t have a central gatekeeper, like a bank, to verify transactions. Instead, both Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies, rely on a consensus mechanism called “proof of work” to maintain a time-ordered ledger of transactions. Crypto miners are at the core of that process.</p>



<p>Decentralization comes at a hefty cost. In the case of proof of work, that cost is computing power. Proof of work pits miners against each other, as they compete to solve a difficult math problem. Any miner who solves the problem first, updates the ledger by appending a new block to the chain, and gets newly minted coins in return. This requires an enormous amount of computing power and, thus, electricity.</p>



<p>Ethereum uses 113 terawatt-hours per year—as much power as the Netherlands, according to <a href="https://archive.is/q3EW4">Digiconomist</a>. A single Ethereum transaction can consume as much power as an average US household uses in more than a week. Bitcoin’s energy consumption is <a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/">even worse</a>.</p>





<p>Right now the world is facing a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-power-shortfalls-begin-to-ripple-around-the-world-11633101100">power crunch</a>, which is partly why China <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/24/chinas-latest-crypto-ban-is-its-most-severe-insiders-say/">banned crypto mining</a> last year, and why countries like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/kosovo-bans-cryptocurrency-mining-save-electricity-2022-01-04/">Kosovo</a> and Kazakhstan, where the miners scattered off to, are pushing miners out and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/25/kazakh-crypto-miners-cut-off-from-electricity-supply-until-end-of-january/">cutting off their electricity</a>. These countries need the power to keep their businesses running and their homes warm.</p>



<p>Not only does proof of work waste electricity, it generates electronic waste as well. Specialized computer servers used for crypto mining often become obsolete in 1.5 years, and they end up in landfills.</p>



<p>Ethereum’s mechanism has other drawbacks—it’s tediously slow, averaging 15 transactions per second. And it doesn’t scale. CryptoKitties, a game where players breed and trade cartoon cats, caused <a href="https://qz.com/1145833/cryptokitties-is-causing-ethereum-network-congestion/">a transaction pileup</a> on the network in 2017.</p>



<p>With all the money venture capital firms are <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/02/08/venture-capital-firms-are-shoveling-cash-at-companies-building-web3-heres-what-comes-next/">shoveling </a><a href="https://fortune.com/2022/02/08/venture-capital-firms-are-shoveling-cash-at-companies-building-web3-heres-what-comes-next/">into Web3</a>—a futuristic model where apps will all run on decentralized blockchains, much of it powered by Ethereum itself—now is a good time for Ethereum to disassociate from proof-of-work mining. And that’s the game plan.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><strong><em>To support MIT Technology Review&#8217;s journalism, please consider <a href="https://forms.technologyreview.com/subscriptions/">becoming a subscriber</a></em></strong>.</p></blockquote>



<p>Sometime in the first half of 2022, in a dramatic event termed “<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/">The Merge</a>,” Ethereum plans to transition its entire network to a different consensus mechanism: proof of stake, which it promises will use 99% less energy, allow the network to scale, and potentially help it reach 100,000 transactions per second.</p>



<p>Of course, Ethereum’s move to proof of stake has been <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-casper-proof-stake-rewrite-rules-blockchain/">six months away</a> for years now. “[We thought] it would take one year to [implement] POS … but it actually [has] taken around six years,” Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin, <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/05/27/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-proof-of-stake-environment-carbon/">told Fortune</a> in May 2021. That’s because building such a model is complex.</p>



<h3><strong>What is proof of work?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Bitcoin was the first blockchain. Its creator wanted to do away with the control that third parties, often big banks or states, exerted over financial systems.</p>



<p>In a blockchain where participants maintain a shared ledger, Bitcoin’s creator needed to find a way to keep people from trying to game the system and spend the same coins twice. Proof of work was a clever kludge—it wasn’t perfect, but it worked well enough.</p>



<p>By demanding a significant upfront investment, “proof of something” keeps bad actors from setting up large numbers of seemingly independent virtual nodes and using them to gain influence over the network. Essentially, you have to pay to play.</p>





<p>In Bitcoin’s proof of work, that investment is hardware. Roughly every 10 minutes, Bitcoin miners compete to solve a puzzle. The winner appends the next block to the chain and claims new bitcoins in the form of the block reward. But finding the solution is like trying to win a lottery. You have to guess over and over until you get lucky. The more powerful the computer, the more guesses you can make.</p>



<p>Sprawling server farms around the globe are dedicated entirely to just that, throwing out trillions of guesses a second. And the larger the mining operation, the larger their cost savings, and thus, the greater their market share. This works against the concept of decentralization. Any system that uses proof of work will naturally re-centralize.</p>



<p>In the case of Bitcoin, this ended up putting a handful of big companies in <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing/why-centralized-crypto-mining-growing-problem/?ref=hackernoon.com">control of the network</a>.</p>



<p>Since early on in Bitcoin’s history, though, crypto enthusiasts have searched for other consensus mechanisms that can preserve some degree of decentralization—and aren’t as wasteful and destructive to the planet as proof of work.</p>



<h3><strong>How proof of stake works</strong></h3>



<p>Proof of stake, <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=27787.0">first proposed</a> on an online forum called BitcoinTalk on July 11,&nbsp; 2011, has been one of the more popular alternatives. In fact, it was supposed to be the mechanism securing Ethereum from the start, according to the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/">white paper</a> that initially described the new blockchain in 2013. But as Buterin noted in 2014, developing such a system was “so non-trivial that some even <a href="https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/alts.pdf">consider it impossible</a>.” So Ethereum launched with a proof-of-work model instead, and set to work developing a proof-of-stake algorithm.</p>



<p>Proof of stake does away with miners and replaces them with “validators.” Instead of investing in energy-intensive computer farms, you invest in the native coins of the system. To become a validator and to win the block rewards, you lock up—or stake—your tokens in a smart contract, a bit of computer code that runs on the blockchain. When you send cryptocurrency to the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa">smart contract’s wallet address</a>, the contract holds that currency, sort of like depositing money in a vault.</p>





<p>In the proof-of-stake system Ethereum is slowly moving to, you put up 32 ether—currently worth $100,000—to become a validator. If you don’t have that kind of spare change on hand, and not many people do, you can join a <a href="https://beaconcha.in/stakingServices">staking service</a> where participants serve as validators jointly.</p>



<p>An algorithm selects from a pool of validators based on the amount of funds they have locked up. The more you stake, the greater your chance of “winning the lottery.” If you’re chosen and your block is accepted by a committee of “attestors”—a group of validators randomly chosen by an algorithm—you are awarded newly minted ether.</p>



<p>Ethereum’s proponents claim that a key advantage proof of stake offers over proof of work is an economic incentive to play by the rules. If a node validates bad transactions or blocks, the validators face “slashing,” which means all their ether are “burned.” (When coins are burned, they are sent to an unusable wallet address where nobody has access to the key, rendering them effectively useless forever.)</p>



<p>Proponents also claim that proof of stake is more secure than proof of work. To attack a proof-of-work chain, you must have more than half the computing power in the network. In contrast, with proof of stake, you must control more than half the coins in the system. As with proof of work, this is difficult but not impossible to achieve.</p>



<p>Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system is already being tested on the <a href="https://beaconscan.com/">Beacon Chain</a>, launched on December 1, 2020. So far 9,500,000 ETH ($37 billion, in current value) has been staked there. The plan is to merge it with the main Ethereum chain in the next few months.</p>





<p>Other upgrades will follow. After the blockchains merge, Ethereum will introduce <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/shard-chains/">sharding</a>, a method of breaking down the single Ethereum blockchain into 64 separate chains, which will all be coordinated by the Beacon Chain.</p>



<p>Shard chains will allow for parallel processing, so the network can scale and support many more users than it currently does. Many see the inclusion of shard chains as the official completion of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, but it’s not scheduled to happen until 2023.</p>



<p>Later on, a technique called “rollups” will speed transactions by executing them off chain and sending the data back to the main Ethereum network.</p>



<h3><strong>A risky move</strong></h3>



<p>None of this comes without risks. Ethereum’s switch to proof of stake is an enormous undertaking. <a href="https://www.stateofthedapps.com/platforms/ethereum">Thousands of existing smart contracts</a> operate on the Ethereum chain, with billions of dollars in assets at stake.</p>



<p>And though staking is not as directly damaging to the planet as warehouses full of computer systems, critics point out that proof of stake is no more effective than proof of work at maintaining decentralization. Those who stake the most money make the most money.</p>



<p>Proof of stake also hasn’t been proven on the scale that proof-of-work platforms have. Bitcoin has been around for over a decade. Several other chains use proof of stake—Algorand, Cardano, Tezos—but these are tiny projects compared with Ethereum. So new vulnerabilities could surface once the new system is in wide release.</p>





<p>As Ethereum transitions to its new protocol, another risk is that a group of disgruntled miners could decide to create a competing chain. All of the smart contracts, coins, and NFTs that exist on the current chain would be automatically duplicated on the forked, or copied chain.</p>



<p>Something similar happened in 2016, after Ethereum developers rolled back the blockchain to erase a massive hack. Some community members were so upset they kept mining the original chain, resulting in two Ethereums—<a href="https://ethereumclassic.org/">Ethereum Classic</a> and what we have today. If it happens again, the success (and mining power) behind any competing version of Ethereum will depend on the value of its coin in the open markets.</p>



<p>Ethereum needs to move to proof of stake so it doesn’t further exacerbate the environmental horrors of Bitcoin. The question is, will its new system fulfill all the promises made for proof of stake? And how decentralized will it really be? If a public blockchain isn’t decentralized, what is the point of proof of anything? You end up doing all that work—consuming vast amounts of energy or staking all those coins—for nothing other than maintaining an illusion.</p>



<p><em>Correction: The current and future transaction speeds for Ethereum’s blockchain were updated to 15 transactions per second and potentially as high as 100,000 transactions per second, respectively.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Law enforcement agencies in Minnesota have been carrying out a secretive, long-running surveillance program targeting civil rights activists and journalists in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd in May 2020. Run under a consortium known as Operation Safety Net, the program was set up a year ago, ostensibly to maintain public order as Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin went on trial for Floyd’s murder. But an investigation by MIT Technology Review reveals that the initiative expanded far beyond its publicly announced scope to include expansive use of tools to scour social media, track cell phones, and amass detailed images of people’s faces.</p>



<p>Documents obtained via public records requests show that the operation persisted long after Chauvin’s trial concluded. What’s more, they show that police used the extensive investigative powers they’d been afforded under the operation to monitor individuals who weren’t suspected of any crime.</p>



<p>MIT Technology Review’s investigation includes thousands of documents and more than two dozen interviews with Minnesota state employees, policing experts, and activists. Taken together, they paint a picture of a state operation intent on identifying participants through secretive surveillance operations. Though it was undertaken by nonmilitary governmental agencies using public funds, large swaths of its inner workings have gone undisclosed. We found evidence of a complex engine of surveillance tailor-made for keeping close tabs on protesters and sharing that information among local and federal agencies, regardless of whether the subjects were suspected of any wrongdoing.</p>



<p>Operation Safety Net (OSN) was announced in February 2021, a month before Chauvin’s trial was set to begin. At a press conference also attended by Hennepin County sheriff David Hutchinson, Medaria Arradondo, then Minneapolis’s police chief, described the effort as a unified command that would enable law enforcement officials to mount a regional response in case protests turned violent.</p>



<p>Publicly, OSN acknowledged that federal agencies would assist in monitoring for threats of violence and activity by out-of-state extremist groups, and that an “intel team” would be established to help share information surrounding these threats. Our investigation shows that federal support for OSN was in fact extensive, involving the US Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. At least six FBI agents served in executive and intelligence roles for the program.</p>



<p>According to OSN’s website, which was shut down on January 19, the program’s mission was to “preserve and protect lawful First Amendment nonviolent protests and demonstrations before, during, and after the trial of Chauvin, who was charged in George Floyd’s death.” The site added, “Operation Safety Net is also dedicated to preventing violent civil disturbances, assaultive actions, property damage, fires, and looting to government buildings, businesses, and critical infrastructure.”</p>



<p>OSN hasn’t tweeted, posted on Facebook, or held a press conference since the week Derek Chauvin’s guilty verdict was issued in April 2021. At that time, officials told the public that the program was “ramping down,” apart from weekly coordination meetings and preparations for future trials. “We are already starting to maneuver, move people off of property protection details,” Major General Shawn Manke of the Minnesota National Guard said at the time. “We’re preparing those soldiers and airmen to leave the Twin Cities metro area and head back to their locations.”</p>



<p>In an email to MIT Technology Review in October 2021, spokesperson Doug Neville wrote that OSN is “not an ongoing operation.”</p>



<p>However, according to emails obtained and reviewed as part of our investigation, the operation does appear to be actively ongoing, with regular planning meetings of the executive and intelligence teams—where it has been referred to as “OSN 2.0”—and sharing of intelligence documents. No information about the goals or extent of the new engagement has been publicly disclosed and officials contacted about the program denied it had been formally renewed.</p>



<p>Documents unearthed as part of this investigation shine a light on secretive surveillance programs, new technology vendors, murky supply chains used to arm riot police, and several watch lists, as well as other previously unreported information. Taken together, they reveal how advanced surveillance techniques and technologies employed by the state, sometimes in an extra-legal fashion, have changed the nature of protest in the United States, effectively bringing an end to Americans’ ability to exercise their First Amendment rights anonymously in public spaces. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld the right to anonymous free speech as a core tenet of the First Amendment, particularly when it comes to unpopular speech.</p>

<h3><strong>The operation</strong></h3>



<p>When Operation Safety Net was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DmWTnlhmXc">announced</a> on February 17, 2021, Chauvin’s trial was looming. It had been nine months since the Minneapolis Police Department’s third precinct headquarters had been burned down amid tumultuous protest, and many feared that tensions could flare again. During the press conference—flanked by local and state law enforcement leadership, including the National Guard—Chief Arradondo laid out the program’s plan. He explained, “The focus and concentration will be in and around our downtown plaza corridor … This will be a unified command. It will allow all of us to be able to respond metro and region-wide if needed.”</p>



<p>At the same press conference, Sheriff David Hutchinson of Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, spoke about how he would use county resources to protect the courthouse where Chauvin’s trial would be held. Hutchinson explained the main role of the sheriff’s office: “Court security. Our job is to ensure the integrity of the court proceedings and the safety of everybody who’s a part of it … I’m confident together we can ensure the court proceedings take place with no disruptions.” Each law enforcement leader who spoke promised that protests would be allowed. Some claimed they were encouraged. John Harrington, commissioner of the Department of Public Safety, said: “We are going to protect people’s constitutional rights and we are going to protect people’s property.”</p>



<p>The city of Minneapolis also planned to <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/02/26/amid-massive-security-presence-minneapolis-is-turning-to-grassroots-to-keep-the-peace/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/02/26/amid-massive-security-presence-minneapolis-is-turning-to-grassroots-to-keep-the-peace/">pay local influencers to communicate on the city’s behalf</a> in an effort to “de-escalate” and “fight misinformation.” After much criticism, these plans were later canceled.</p>

<p>Operation Safety Net was designed to have four phases, according to police officials. According to slides from the initial press conference, phase one involved preliminary planning, and phase two was meant for any protests that arose during jury selection. Chauvin’s trial began on March 29, 2021, in Minneapolis. Phase three was to start when the trial reached the closing arguments and a verdict, and Arradondo told residents to expect a “visual” ramp-up of police presence at that point. According to the operational plan outlined in the first press conference, this phase was to usher in the “full deployment of law enforcement and the national guard.” <a href="https://twitter.com/ur_ninja/status/1382133792480067587">Armored vehicles</a>, flash-bang grenades, rubber bullets, pepper spray and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/30/teargas-effect-children-police-minnesota-brooklyn-center">tear gas</a>, as well as drones and other aircraft, were all features of phase three.</p>

Agencies that are part of the effort include Minneapolis Police, Metro Transit Police, Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, Ramsey County Sheriff’s Office, the Minnesota State Patrol, the Minnesota National Guard, and other entities.” The FBI and DHS were also key partners in the program.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But Operation Safety Net would enter phase three on the morning of April 12—a week before closing arguments and eight days before the verdict in Chauvin’s case was delivered. Its focus would turn from the trial to protests in Brooklyn Center, a suburb north of Minneapolis, where a police officer had shot and killed 20-year-old Daunte Wright during a traffic stop the day before.</p>



<p>The night of April 11, activists gathered outside the Brooklyn Center Police Department in defiance of a curfew. The police station was quickly fortified by fencing and barriers. Police made liberal use of tear gas over several nights of protests; it wafted into apartment buildings surrounding the police station and <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/05/17/lesions-and-trauma-some-brooklyn-center-residents-still-affected-by-tear-gas/">injured several residents</a>. The lights on the station were turned off in an effort to make it harder for protesters to <a href="https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/brooklyn-center-police-chief-once-we-got-pelted-we-responded-in-kind">see and target officers</a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/us/brooklyn-center-minnesota-police-shooting.html">News reports estimated that 100 protesters</a> encountered hundreds of police officers, as well as approximately 100 National Guard members. <a href="https://knsiradio.com/2021/04/12/curfew-set-law-enforcement-presence-ramps-up-in-twin-cities-metro-after-sundays-fatal-police-shooting-rioting/">Around 30 arrests</a> were made.</p>





<p>The next day, school was canceled. In response to the chaos of the previous night, the Brooklyn Center City Council hurried to pass a resolution banning aggressive police tactics such as rubber bullets, tear gas, and “kettling,” in which groups of protesters are blocked into a confined space. A curfew was also put into effect from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. The council’s resolution went into effect by nightfall on the 12th, but police <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/brooklyn-center-cops-banned-from-launching-tear-gas-then-use-it-15-minutes-later">continued using the banned tactics and munitions</a>. That night, approximately <a href="https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/fatal-police-shooting-sparks-civil-unrest-in-brooklyn-center">20 businesses in the area were broken into</a>.</p>



<p>As part of the operation, Minneapolis Police also <a href="https://unicornriot.ninja/2021/aerial-surveillance-in-twin-cities-frustrates-alarms-residents/">summoned helicopters from Customs and Border Protection</a> (part of the US Department of Homeland Security). The presence of circling aircraft would become a hallmark of Operation Safety Net. During the peak of the protests, the helicopters came and went from a difficult-to-access industrial area near the Mississippi River between Brooklyn Center and Minneapolis, flying at high altitudes to avoid detection.</p>



<p>On at least two nights during the height of the protests, which spanned nearly 10 days, law enforcement briefly detained and took detailed photographs of credentialed members of the press who were covering the events.</p>



<p>The ACLU of Minnesota, along with pro bono lawyers from private law firms Fredrikson &amp; Byron P.A., the law office of Kevin Riach and Apollo Law, <a href="https://www.aclu-mn.org/en/press-releases/goyettesettlement">recently settled a class action lawsuit</a> against the Minnesota State Patrol over its treatment of journalists during the protests. The settlement requires the State Patrol to pay $825,000 to injured journalists, and a federal judge ordered an injunction lasting six years that prohibits the State Patrol and jointly responding agencies from attacking and arresting journalists, or ordering them to disperse from the scene of a protest. (Similar allegations are still being pursued against the city of Minneapolis and several officials.)</p>



<p>On April 15, more than 75 community organizations, including the ACLU, issued a joint statement <a href="https://takeactionminnesota.org/statement-community-organizations-call-on-walz-frey-carter-and-hutchinson-to-stop-operation-safety-net-immediately/">calling for the state to end</a> OSN. “The state’s use of force against Minnesotans exercising their First Amendment rights in Brooklyn Center and militarization of our cities in response to police violence is wrong, traumatizing, and adding to the public health crisis of COVID, police brutality, and systemic racism,” the statement read. It called out the “continued use of militaristic tools of oppression to intimidate and halt peaceful, if justifiably angry, protest.” The NAACP also <a href="https://twitter.com/NAACPmpls/status/1384541487044702208">called for a stop to Operation Safety Net</a> via Twitter.</p>



<p>The Minneapolis Legislative Delegation, a group of state legislators, <a href="https://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/members/profile/news/15535/31739">sent a letter</a> to Minnesota governor Tim Walz condemning OSN and asking for a “reevaluation of tactics.” Congresswoman Ilhan Omar also <a href="https://twitter.com/ilhanmn/status/1383568440116486144">criticized OSN</a>, likening it to “a military occupation” and calling on Walz and Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey to “stop terrorizing people who are protesting the brutality of state sanctioned violence.” On April 22,<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/trial-over-killing-of-george-floyd/2021/04/21/989446758/doj-to-investigate-minneapolis-police-for-possible-patterns-of-excessive-force"> the US Department of Justice announced an investigation </a>into the Minneapolis Police Department, citing a possible pattern of excessive use of force including in response to protests. The investigation is ongoing.</p>



<p>All told, the operation cost tens of millions of public dollars, paid by the participating agencies. The Minnesota State Patrol alone paid $1,048,946.57, according to an email sent to MIT Technology Review, and the Minnesota National Guard estimated that its role cost at least $25 million.</p>



<p>Despite the public costs, the detentions, and the criticism, however, most details of OSN’s attempts to surveil the public remained secret.</p>



<h3><strong>Surveillance tools</strong></h3>



<p>As part of our investigation, MIT Technology Review obtained a watch list used by the agencies in the operation that includes photos and personal information identifying journalists and other people “doing nothing more than exercising their constitutional rights,” Leita Walker, a lawyer representing journalists arrested in the protests who has examined the list, wrote in court documents. It was compiled by the Criminal Intelligence Division of the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office—one of the groups participating in OSN—and included people arrested by the Minnesota State Patrol, another participant.</p>



<p>The Minnesota State Patrol and Minneapolis Police Department both told MIT Technology Review in an email that they were not aware of the document and Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office did not reply to multiple requests for comment.</p>



<p>OSN also used a real-time data-sharing tool called Intrepid Response, which is sold on a subscription basis by AT&amp;T. It’s much like a Slack for SWAT: at the press of a button, images, video (including footage captured by drones), geolocations of team members and targets, and other data can be instantly shared between field teams and command center staff. Credentialed members of the press who were covering the unrest in Brooklyn Center were temporarily detained and photographed, and those photos were uploaded into the Intrepid Response system.</p>



<p>Although the State Patrol denied numerous records requests from MIT Technology Review regarding the detention and photographing of journalists, photojournalist J.D. Duggan was able to obtain his personal file—a total of three pages of material. The information Duggan obtained illuminates the extent of law enforcement’s efforts to track individuals in real time: the pages include photos of his face, body, and press badge, surrounded by time stamps and maps showing the location of his brief detention.</p>

<p>Previous <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/george-floyd-protests-surveillance-technology">reporting</a> has shown that policing agencies participating in OSN also had access to many other technological surveillance tools, including a face recognition system made by the controversial firm <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/09/1022240/clearview-ai-nypd-emails/">Clearview AI</a>, cell site simulators for cell-phone surveillance, license plate readers, and drones. Extensive social media intelligence gathering was a core part of OSN as well.</p>



<p>Drones were also used during the earlier protests following Floyd’s murder, when <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/5/29/21274828/drone-minneapolis-protests-predator-surveillance-police">a Predator operated by US Customs and Border Patrol</a>—a technology typically used to monitor battlefields in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere—was spotted flying over the city. Interestingly, the drone flight and two National Guard spy plane flights revealed that the aerial surveillance technology the police already owned was actually superior. In a report, the inspector general of the US Air Force said, “Minnesota State Police transmitted their helicopter images … and noted the police imagery was much better quality” than that provided by the RC-26 spy planes the military operated over Minneapolis in the first week of June 2020. Police also issued a warrant to obtain <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/minneapolis-protests-geofence-warrant/">Google geolocation</a> information of people involved in the protests in May 2020.</p>



<h3><strong>The intelligence teams</strong></h3>



<p>In total, OSN would require officers from nine agencies in Minnesota, <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2021/04/21/operation-safety-net-massive-chauvin-trial-security-task-force-will-conclude-this-week/">120 out-of-state </a>supporting officers, and at least 3,000 National Guard soldiers. The surveillance tools were managed by several different intelligence groups that collaborated throughout the operation. The structure of these intelligence teams, the personnel, and the extent of the involvement of federal agencies have not previously been reported.</p>



<p>In the same area where helicopters from federal agencies were surreptitiously taking off and landing is a facility known as the Strategic Information Center. The SIC, as it’s called, was a central planning site for Operation Safety Net and also functions as an <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Minneapolis%20Police%20Dpt%20Strategic%20Info%20Ctr%20Policies%20%26%20Procedures.pdf">intelligence analysis hub</a>, known as a “fusion center,” for the Minneapolis Police Department. The facility <a href="https://www.fusus.com/blog/press-release-minneapolis-police-department-to-activate-fusus-real-time-crime-center-platform">contains</a> the latest technology and is plugged into citywide camera feeds and data-sharing systems. The SIC featured prominently in documents reviewed for this investigation and was used routinely by OSN leaders to coordinate field operations and intelligence work.</p>



<p>Emails obtained through public records requests shed light on an “intel team” within Operation Safety Net. It was made up of at least 12 people from agencies including the Minneapolis and St. Paul police, the Hennepin County sheriff, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety and Metro Transit, and the FBI. The intel team used the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN), run by the US Department of Homeland Security, to share information and appears to have met regularly through at least October 2021. The network <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/24/1032967/us-government-agencies-plan-to-increase-their-use-of-facial-recognition-technology/">offers access to facial recognition technology</a>, though Bruce Gordon, director of communications at the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, told MIT Technology Review in an email that the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension’s (BCA) fusion center “does not own or use facial recognition technology.”</p>



<p>Our investigation shows clear and substantial involvement of federal agencies at the highest level of Operation Safety Net, with four FBI agents included in the executive team of operation in addition to the two on the intel team. Federal agents had also been deployed to several cities, including New York and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/5/22918487/fbi-geofence-seattle-blm-protest-police-guild-attack">Seattle</a>, during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. In Portland, Oregon, the FBI launched a months-long surveillance operation which involved covertly filming activists. On June 2, 2020, the deputy director of the FBI David Bowdich <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/federal-agents-portland-seattle-protests.html">released a memo encouraging aggressive surveillance of the activists</a>, calling the protest movement “a national crisis.” The Department of Homeland Security also deployed around 200 personnel to cities around the US, with most reporting to Portland.</p>



<p>Kyle Rudnitski, listed as an operations manager at the BCA fusion center in his email signature, acted as the administrator of HSIN for the intel team and the host for planning meetings. Rudnitski appeared to also be responsible for managing account permissions for the team.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1452" height="920" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image3-redact.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1046682" srcset="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image3-redact.png 1452w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image3-redact.png?resize=300,190 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image3-redact.png?resize=768,487 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1452px) 100vw, 1452px" /><figcaption>An email regarding the &#8220;OSN &#8211; Intel Team&#8221; monthly check-in sent from the operations manager at the BCA fusion center with access to the Homeland Security Information Network. Obtained via public records request. </figcaption></figure>



<p>The BCA’s fusion center is the primary data-sharing center for Minnesota, but there are several operated by other law enforcement entities throughout the state. The facility is staffed by criminal intelligence analysts and others who run a constellation of intelligence-gathering tools and reporting networks.</p>



<p>Fusion centers are intelligence-sharing and analysis hubs, spread throughout the country, that bring together intelligence from local, state, federal, and other sources. These centers were widely set up in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks to consolidate intelligence and more rapidly assess threats to national security. According to the Department of Homeland Security’s website, these centers are intended to “increase collaboration” between agencies through data sharing. The centers are staffed by multiple police agencies, federal law enforcement and National Guard personnel, and sometimes contractors. The proliferation of these centers has <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/fusion-centers-need-more-rules-oversight">come</a> <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/fusion-center-encourages-improper-investigations-lobbying-groups-and-anti-war">under</a> <a href="https://www.openthegovernment.org/dhs-fusion-centers-full-report/">intense</a> <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/whats-wrong-fusion-centers-executive-summary">scrutiny</a> for raising the risk of abusive policing practices.</p>



<p>“Instead of looking for terrorist threats, fusion centers were monitoring lawful political and religious activity. The Virginia Fusion Center described a Muslim get-out–the-vote campaign as ‘subversive,’” reads a <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/fusion-centers-need-more-rules-oversight">2012 report from the Brennan Center</a>, a law and policy think tank. “In 2009, the North Central Texas Fusion Center identified lobbying by Muslim groups as a possible threat. The DHS dismissed these as isolated episodes, but a two-year Senate investigation found that such tactics were hardly rare. It concluded that fusion centers routinely produce ‘irrelevant, useless, or inappropriate’ intelligence that endangers civil liberties.”</p>



<h3><strong>“Anonymity is a shield”</strong></h3>



<p>In February 2022, policing in Minnesota again became a focus for protests after Minneapolis police shot and killed Amir Locke, a 22-year-old Black man who appeared to be sleeping on a couch when officers executed a no-knock warrant as part of a homicide investigation. Locke was not a suspect in the homicide, as initial police press releases about the incidents falsely claimed.</p>



<p>Despite public statements that OSN was in “phase four” as of April 22, 2021—the final phase, in which the operation would “demobilize,” according to statements given during the initial press conference—it appears that the program was still ongoing when Locke was killed. Documents obtained by MIT Technology Review show that regular planning meetings, secured chat rooms, and the sharing and updating of operation documents remained in effect through at least October.</p>



<p>The emails also contained details about a meeting on October 26, 2021, for the “OSN 2.0 Executive Team” that included among its agenda items “Potter Trial,” referencing the trial of Kim Potter in December, and “March 2022.” The FBI was included in the OSN 2.0 Executive Team emails.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1480" height="762" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OSN-2.0.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1046685" srcset="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OSN-2.0.png 1480w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OSN-2.0.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OSN-2.0.png?resize=768,395 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1480px) 100vw, 1480px" /><figcaption>This agenda for &#8220;OSN 2.0 Executive Team Meeting&#8221; was attached to an email sent by the executive assistant to the chief of Minneapolis police. The email, obtained via public records request, was sent to over 30 people across OSN member groups, including federal agencies.</figcaption></figure>



<p>“There never has been, nor is there now, an ‘OSN 2.0,’” Gordon told MIT Technology Review in email. “Any reference was an informal way of notifying state, local and federal partners that planning would take place … the Minnesota Fusion Center continues to share threat assessment information with law enforcement agencies in keeping with its mission. This was not unique to the time during which OSN existed.” Gordon also disputed the characterization that OSN itself amounted to large-scale surveillance activity.</p>



<p>On Thursday, February 24, the three other officers on the scene when Chauvin murdered George Floyd were found guilty of federal crimes for a violating Floyd’s civil rights, though they still await a state trial.</p>



<p>The events in Minnesota have ushered in a new era of protest policing. Protests that were intended to call attention to the injustices committed by police effectively served as an opportunity for those police forces to consolidate power, bolster their inventories, solidify relationships with federal forces, and update their technology and training to achieve a far more powerful, interconnected surveillance apparatus. Entirely new titles and positions were created within the Minneapolis Police Department and the aviation section of the Minnesota State Patrol that leverage new surveillance technologies and methods, which will be explained in detail in this investigative series.</p>



<p>Anonymity is an important though muddy tenet of free speech. In a landmark 1995 Supreme Court case, <em>McIntyre</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, the court declared that “anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority.” Clare Garvie, a senior associate with the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy &amp; Technology, says the case established that “to hold an unpopular speech and to be free to express that necessarily requires a degree of anonymity.” Though police do have the right to do things like take photographs at protests, Garvie says, “law enforcement does not have the right to walk through a protest and demand that everybody show their ID.”</p>



<p>But a wild proliferation of technologies and tools have recently made such anonymous free speech nearly impossible in the United States. This&nbsp;story is the first in a series that will provide a rare glimpse behind the curtain during a transformative time for policing and public demonstration in the US.</p>



<p><em>Correction: The original version of this story said that the ACLU had settled a lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis. The settlement was against Minnesota State Patrol. A similar action against the city is still ongoing.</em></p>

<p>As Russia poured troops into Ukraine,&nbsp; the besieged country’s government was already thinking about a different way to strike back.</p>



<p>On February 26, Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov launched the “IT Army of Ukraine”—an unprecedented invitation to the world’s hackers to go on the offensive against Russia for his country. The IT Army is the most highly visible force in what’s become a byzantine cyber conflict marked by a chaotic mix of players, impossible-to-verify claims of sabotage, and a scant number of visible hacks.&nbsp;</p>





<p>In fact, hacking has remained mostly on the margins in the first week of the war. Instead, Ukraine’s IT Army and all the other groups now declaring their intent to launch such cyberattacks have all played into a roiling propaganda war touching not just Ukraine and Russia but the entire world.</p>



<p>Ukraine’s strategy of seeking out an international brigade of hackers makes sense for a country under siege, experts say. Would-be participants are directed to a Telegram channel where objectives are laid out clearly in a series of messages. Targets for hacking and DDoS attacks are listed next to manifestos outlining how to wage information war on behalf of Kyiv. The list of targets includes government and financial institutions, meaning that Russia’s critical infrastructure is in the crosshairs. Over 270,000 people have subscribed to the channel so far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Numerous ransomware gangs have also declared their intentions in the conflict. But again, although the messages instantly made headlines, none of the groups have carried out any visible, verifiable attacks. Though hacktivist collectives like Anonymous have been vocal about their own involvement, including claims to have breached Russian government databases, multiple such claims have been quickly debunked. But the grandiose proclamations and misinformation have successfully spread like wildfire. Frauds, liars, and grifters are adding to the chaos of the war.</p>



<p>The confusion extends to groups organized by prominent figures and even governments. The Belarusian Cyber Partisans, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/26/1033205/belarus-cyber-partisans-lukashenko-hack-opposition/">an anti-regime hacking group</a> with a track record of real activity inside its own country, claims to be a part of a hybrid cyber-physical effort to sabotage railroads transporting troops. That’s been impossible to verify.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Ukrainian cyber resistance group, organized by officials from Ukraine’s defense ministry, says it is targeting railroads and power grids inside Russia. It’s a bold claim not backed by any proof. Experts believe that only a few nations possess the capability to interfere with power grids by cyberattack.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p><strong><em>To support MIT Technology Review&#8217;s journalism, please consider <a href="https://forms.technologyreview.com/subscriptions/">becoming a subscriber</a></em></strong>.</p></blockquote>



<p>Ghostwriter, a hacking group linked to Russia and Belarus, has been seen targeting Ukrainian politicians and military personnel—but the group has so far failed to achieve any meaningful success. An unknown hacking group used destructive wiper malware against Ukrainian government targets just hours before the invasion, according to Jean-Ian Boutin, head of ESET Threat Research, but the actual impact there remains unclear as well.</p>



<p>Kaspersky, Russia’s biggest cybersecurity firm, declined an interview request to discuss what its experts are seeing inside Russia. But something is happening: Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Russian media this week that the country is under attack by “cyber terrorists from Ukraine.”</p>





<p>“We’ve never seen all these different players coming out like this before,” says Adam Meyers, senior vice president at the US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when millions of people in city centers are under heavy artillery bombardment, what’s the real value of leaked databases and crippled websites? And how much of an impact has this international “army” really had? It’s hard to tell. When the IT Army sends out an IP address, the target does often go down—usually sooner rather than later. Many Russian sites now work only within Russia itself because they deny all connections from abroad, a defense against international attack without historical precedent on this scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But denial-of-service attacks are technically simple, easily reversible, and far less destructive than Russian missiles striking city centers and Ukrainian Molotov cocktails being thrown to repel the invading army.</p>



<p>All of this plays into the information war happening in both countries and around the world. Russia’s attacks against Ukrainian government and financial institutions in the days before the invasion seemed designed to undermine confidence in Kyiv’s leadership. Likewise, the Ukrainian government’s attempts to take down Russian government sites and launch its own messages inside Russia amount to Kyiv’s brand of information warfare. Ukrainian resistance on the ground and on the cyber front is bolstered by support from the West, a crucial lifeline when the country’s capital is almost entirely surrounded.</p>



<p>“Cyber is a tool leveraged in warfare and spycraft,” Meyers says. “There is an open armed conflict happening. This is no different than Ukraine asking people to come to the country to get a Kalashnikov and help fight the Russians on the ground.”</p>



<p>But the picture looks a bit different when you’re in Washington or London. For years Western governments have condemned cyberattacks from Russian soil. What happens now that Ukraine is openly appealing to hackers for help?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Despite the United States government saying ‘We’re not allowing hacktivists to use American routers to do DDoS attacks on your state propaganda sites,’ Russia is probably not going to believe that,” says Michael E. van Landingham, a former Russia analyst at the CIA. “Russia uses cyber tools as an extension of state power. And Russian leaders mirror-image a lot. I think they’ll perceive attacks from Anonymous or any Western collective as attacks that Western governments promote.”</p>



<p>Much of what the IT Army of Ukraine is promoting is clearly a crime in the United States and every Western country. But the situation raises more than legal questions; it also forces new moral and geopolitical questions to the forefront.</p>



<p>“Governments in the West should strictly enforce laws against hacking against anyone who would attempt to deface or DDoS Russian sites or do anything [illegal] in the cyber realm,” says van Landingham. “That’s the only signaling we have to show it wasn’t a CIA plot, it wasn’t a Cyber Command attack—here’s the person, and here’s what we’re doing about it.”</p>



<p>Despite the chaotic environment, the seeming lack of verifiable major cyber operations coinciding with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is one of the big unknowns looming over the entire war. Russia has launched devastating cyberattacks on Ukraine in recent years but so far has stuck with traditional warfare since its invasion. The question is whether it may still turn to cyber in the coming weeks and months as the war drags on.</p>
